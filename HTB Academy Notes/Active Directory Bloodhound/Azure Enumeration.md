We've learned how to use BloodHound to identify misconfigurations in Active Directory environments, but in this section, we'll focus on Azure and how we can use BloodHound to identify attack paths and potential weaknesses in the Azure environment.

While the main focus of this section will be on the offensive usage of BloodHound in Azure, it's important to note that both Red and Blue Teams can benefit from this tool. Red Teams can use the information gathered by BloodHound to identify attack paths, and Blue Teams to prioritize remediation efforts and secure their Azure environment. BloodHound provides valuable insights into the security of Azure environments, whether for offensive or defensive purposes.

## Overview AzureHound

Just as we discussed attacks on Active Directory environments and the different components that BloodHound includes to allow us to identify attack paths, in the same way, we can use BloodHound to identify Attack paths in Azure.

The approach to identify attacks and abuse edges are similar to Active Directory. For Azure, we will have nodes and edges that start with `Az` exclusive to the Microsoft cloud.

The nodes available in BloodHound version 4.2 are the following:

| Node | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AZTenant](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/nodes.html#aztenant) | Represents an Azure AD tenant, which is a dedicated instance of Azure AD that an organization owns and uses to manage access to applications and resources. |
| [AZUser](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/nodes.html#AzUser) | Represents a user in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and contains information about the user such as their email address, display name, and job title. |
| [AZGroup](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/nodes.html#AzGroup) | Represents a group in Azure AD, which can be used to manage access to resources and applications. |
| [AZApp](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/nodes.html#AzApp) | Represents an application in Azure AD, which can be used to provide secure access to resources and APIs. |

**Note:** Keep in mind that not all edges are documented. Most of them have different details for their attack path than we had in Active Directory. Cloud environments can change rapidly, and we must keep up to date with the changes as they occur.

For additional information about these nodes, their uses, and definitions, we can refer to the [official BloodHound documentation](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Creating an Azure Tenant

To practice in an Azure environment, we need to create a tenant with an Azure Subscription. We will use the free version of Azure, which gives us $200 USD for one month. To complete the registration for the free version, we can use the following link: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). Note that a credit card is required. Additionally, if you are a student, you can use [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) with no credit card required.

**Note:** These exercises are optional, but it is recommended that they be performed to familiarize yourself with cloud attacks. To complete these exercises, we will need to create the free Azure account using the link above.

You can follow the process based on the [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) page. The following example is a reference, but the process may differ for you and the region where you are.

1.  Go to the [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) portal and follow the process starting by clicking on `Start free`.

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azure_free_account_1.jpg)

2.  Create a new account:

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azure_free_account_2.jpg)

3.  We can use an existing email or create a new one. For this exercise, we will use an already existing email.

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azure_free_account_3.jpg)

4.  Set a Password:

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azure_free_account_4.jpg)

5.  We will receive a confirmation email to verify our identity:

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azure_free_account_5.jpg)

6.  Use the code you receive to verify your email:

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azure_free_account_6.jpg)

7.  Complete the puzzle:

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azure_free_account_7.jpg)

8.  Add your information:

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azure_free_account_8.jpg)

9.  Verify your phone:

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azure_free_account_9.jpg)

10.  Add the credit card information and complete the process.

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azure_free_account_10.jpg)

**Note:** If you had an error while registering, it could be for multiple reasons. One of the most common is that you had already used Azure Free.

You could use Pay-As-You-Go to complete the exercise. The average cost will be around ~5.00 USD if you use it for a week. However, you will have to manually delete the created resources and cancel your subscription so that it does not generate additional costs.

Complete the registration process and visit the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Using TheEdgeMaker

Once we have created our Azure account and subscription, we can use [TheEdgeMaker](https://github.com/juliourena/TheEdgeMaker). A PowerShell script that allows us to create Azure Edges for use in BloodHound automatically.

**Note:** By using this Script, we are creating weak configurations in Azure to perform the practices. Make sure to use it in a controlled environment. It is not recommended for use in production, development, or an environment not created for this purpose.

1.  Connect to the target machine and run PowerShell as Administrator and execute the Script:

#### Execute TheEdgeMaker

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\TheEdgeMaker> .\TheEdgeMaker.ps1
```

#### Login with the Azure Account we created

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azurehound_login.jpg)

#### Execute TheEdgeMaker

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\TheEdgeMaker> .\TheEdgeMaker.ps1 Account SubscriptionName TenantId Environment ------- ---------------- -------- ----------- plaintexthackthebox@gmail.com Azure subscription 1 92e13faa-6af8-4501-80b9-421271bc3e38 AzureCloud Name : Azure subscription 1 (4c30dd8a-ea98-4d0b-bb15-86f011cafc17) - 92e13faa-6af8-4501-80b9-421271bc3e38 - plaintexthackthebox@gmail.com Account : plaintexthackthebox@gmail.com Environment : AzureCloud Subscription : 4c30dd8a-ea98-4d0b-bb15-86f011cafc17 Tenant : 92e13faa-6af8-4501-80b9-421271bc3e38 TokenCache : VersionProfile : ExtendedProperties : {} ## Tenant Information Tenant: plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com The current location is 'East US'. Do you want to change it? (Y/N): N ...SNIP...
```

The output includes the tenant name, in this case: `plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com`. We will need this information when to run AzureHound. Make sure to take note of your tenant name.

The Script stops to inform us which is the location of the resources we will create in Azure. By default, it uses `East US`. We will keep this location by pressing `N`.

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\TheEdgeMaker> .\TheEdgeMaker.ps1 ...SNIP... ## The current location is 'East US'. ## Creating Users [+] AAD Account Created Successfully - Emily Smith [+] AAD Account Created Successfully - Madison Johnson [+] AAD Account Created Successfully - Avery Williams [+] AAD Account Created Successfully - Sophia Jones [+] AAD Account Created Successfully - Olivia Brown [+] AAD Account Created Successfully - Abigail Davis [+] AAD Account Created Successfully - Isabella Miller [+] AAD Account Created Successfully - Mia Wilson [+] AAD Account Created Successfully - Charlotte Moore [+] AAD Account Created Successfully - Ava Taylor ## Creating Resource Group ResourceGroupName : RG-KeyVault Location : eastus ProvisioningState : Succeeded Tags : TagsTable : ResourceId : /subscriptions/4c30dd8a-ea98-4d0b-bb15-86f011cafc17/resourceGroups/RG-KeyVault ManagedBy : [+] Resource group 'RG-KeyVault' created successfully in East US. ...SNIP...
```

Once it is finished, we are ready to execute AzureHound.

## Using AzureHound

AzureHound is a Go binary that collects data from AzureAD and AzureRM via the MS Graph and Azure REST APIs. It does not use external dependencies and will run on any operating system. We can build [AzureHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/AzureHound) from the source or download it from their [github repository](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/AzureHound/releases). AzureHound is in the `C:\Tools` directory in the target machine.

There are several authentication methods for AzureHound:

-   Username and Password
-   JSON Web Token (JWT)
-   Refresh Token
-   Service Principal Secret
-   Service Principal Certificate

For this exercise, we will use a username and password. To learn more about other methods, please visit [AzureHound official documentation](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-collection/azurehound.html).

We will assume we compromise Isabella Miller's account, and her password is `HacktheboxAcademy01!`. Make sure to replace the domain name `plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com` with the corresponding tenant for your environment.

#### Running AzureHound

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> .\azurehound.exe -u "Isabella.Miller@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com" -p "HacktheboxAcademy01!" list --tenant "plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com" -o all.json AzureHound v1.2.3 Created by the BloodHound Enterprise team - https://bloodhoundenterprise.io No configuration file located at C:\Users\julio\.config\azurehound\config.json No configuration file located at C:\Users\julio\.config\azurehound\config.json 2023-02-17T11:09:21-06:00 INF collecting azure objects... 2023-02-17T11:09:21-06:00 INF finished listing all groups count=9 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all subscriptions count=0 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all key vaults 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all resource groups 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all subscription role assignments 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all subscription user access admins 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all resource group role assignments 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all virtual machines 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all virtual machine role assignments 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all key vault role assignments 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all devices count=0 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all device owners 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all users count=11 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all apps count=1 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF warning: unable to process azure management groups; either the organization has no management groups or azurehound does not have the reader role on the root management group. 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all management group role assignments 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all management group descendants 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing members for all groups 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 ERR unable to continue processing role assignments for this role error="map[error:map[code:Request_ResourceNotFound innerError:map[client-request-id:a09b506e-758c-4bce-9c49-2f6df2e4776e date:2023-02-17T17:09:11 request-id:a09b506e-758c-4bce-9c49-2f6df2e4776e] message:Resource 'a0b1b346-4d3e-4e8b-98f8-753987be4970' does not exist or one of its queried reference-property objects are not present.]]" roleDefinitionId=a0b1b346-4d3e-4e8b-98f8-753987be4970 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all group owners 2023-02-17T11:09:22-06:00 INF finished listing all app owners 2023-02-17T11:09:23-06:00 INF finished listing all tenants count=2 2023-02-17T11:09:23-06:00 INF finished listing all service principals count=54 2023-02-17T11:09:23-06:00 INF finished listing all roles count=97 2023-02-17T11:09:23-06:00 INF finished listing all app role assignments 2023-02-17T11:09:23-06:00 INF finished listing all role assignments 2023-02-17T11:09:23-06:00 INF finished listing all service principal owners 2023-02-17T11:09:23-06:00 INF collection completed duration=2.192815s shutting down gracefully, press ctrl+c again to force
```

Now we need to import the output file `all.json` into BloodHound:

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azurehound_import2.gif)

We can start using BloodHound to identify different attack paths since there are no pre-built queries for Azure. We will use the `Transitive Object Control` option to determine what privileges we have from Isabella's account.

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azurehound_isabella2.gif)

We can identify that Isabel has the `Password Administrator` role, which allows us to reset the passwords of non-administrator users.

One thing to consider when working with Azure is that, by default, users do not have the privilege to read all Azure objects. There may be objects in Azure that, if the user we authenticate with does not have rights to read, we will not be able to enumerate. For example, if we search and type `AZSubscription:` or `AZVM:`, BloodHound will not return any data because Isabella doesn't have the right to read the subscription object.

## Next Steps

In the next section, we will explore how to abuse those edges and compromise an account with read privileges over the subscription to enumerate the Azure environment further.

**Note:** To avoid any cost after you finish your Azure testing, we recommend you cancel your Azure subscription following these steps: [Cancel your Azure subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/cancel-azure-subscription).
