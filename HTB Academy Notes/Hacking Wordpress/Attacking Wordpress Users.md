## Attacking WordPress Users

## WordPress User Bruteforce

WPScan can be used to brute force usernames and passwords. The scan report returned three users registered on the website: `admin`, `roger`, and `david`. The tool uses two kinds of login brute force attacks, `xmlrpc` and `wp-login`. The `wp-login` method will attempt to brute force the normal WordPress login page, while the `xmlrpc` method uses the WordPress API to make login attempts through `/xmlrpc.php`. The `xmlrpc` method is preferred as it is faster.

#### WPscan - XMLRPC

p3ta@htb[/htb]$ wpscan --password-attack xmlrpc -t 20 -U admin, david -P passwords.txt --url http://blog.inlanefreight.com
